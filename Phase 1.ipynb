today I participated in a World Health Organization forum In that forum we talked about ways that government officials NGOs and individual citizens are working to address the health problems of women and girls Tomorrow I will attend a gathering of the United Nations Development Fund for Women There the discussion will focus on local and highly successful programs that give hardworking women access to credit so they can improve their own lives and the lives of their families What we are learning around the world is that if women are healthy and educated their families will flourish If women are free from violence their families will flourish If women have a chance to work and earn as full and equal partners in society their families will flourish And when families flourish communities a nd nations do as well That is why every woman every man every child every family and ev ery nation on this planet does have a stake in the discussion that takes place here Over the past 25 years I have

      "in the coming years, artificial intelligence is probably going to change your life, and likely the entire world. but people have a hard time agreeing on exactly how. the following are excerpts from an interview where renowned computer science professor and ai expert stuart russell helps separate the sense from the nonsense. there’s a big difference between asking a human to do something and giving that as the objective to an ai system. when you ask a human to get you a cup of coffee, you don’t mean t his should be their life’s mission, and nothing else in the universe matters. even if they have to kill everybody else in starbucks to get you the coffee before it closes — they should do that. no, that’s not what you mean. all the other things that we mutu ally care about, they should factor into your behavior as well. and the problem with the way we build ai systems now is we give them a fixed objective. the algorithms require us to specify everything in the objective. and if you say, can we fix the acidification of the oceans? yeah, you could have a catalytic reaction that does that extremely efficiently, but it consumes a quarter of the oxygen in the atmosphere, which would apparently cause us to die fairly slowly and unpleasantly over the course of several hours. so, how do we avoid this problem? you might say, okay, well, just be more careful about specifying the objective — don’t forget the atmospheric oxygen. and then, of course, some side effect of the reaction in the ocean poisons all the fish. okay, well i meant don’t kill the fish either. and then, well, what about the seaweed? don’t do anything that’s going to cause all the seaweed to die. and on and on and on. and the reason that we don’t have to do that with humans is that huma ns often know that they don’t know all the things that we care about. if you ask a human to get you a cup of coffee, and you happen to be in the hotel george sand in paris, where the coffee is 13 euros a cup, it’s entirely reasonable to come back and say, well, it’s 13 euros, are you sure you want it, or i could go next door and get one? and it’s a perfectly normal thing for a person to do. to ask, i’m going to repaint your house — is it okay if i take off the drainpipes and then put them back? we don't thin k of this as a terribly sophisticated capability, but ai systems don’t have it because the way we build them now, they have to know the full objective. if we build systems that know that they don’t know what the objective is, then they start to exhibit the se behaviors, like asking permission before getting rid of all the oxygen in the atmosphere. in all these senses, control over the ai system comes from the machine’s uncertainty about what the true objective is. and it’s when you build machines that believe with certainty that they have the objective, that’s when you get this sort of psychopathic behavior. and i think we see the same thing in humans. what happens when general purpose ai hits the real economy? how do things change? can we adapt ? this is a very old point. amazingly, aristotle actually has a passage where he says, look, if we had fully automated weaving machines and plectrums that could pluck the lyre and produce music without any humans, then we wouldn’t need any workers. that idea, which i think it was keynes who called it technological unemployment in 1930, is very obvious to people. they think, yeah, of course, if the machine does the work, then i'm going to be unemployed. you can think about the warehouses that c ompanies are currently operating for e -commerce, they are half automated. the way it works is that an old warehouse — where you’ve got tons of stuff piled up all over the place and humans go and rummage around and then bring it back and send it off — there’s a robot who goes and gets the shelving unit that contains the thing that you need, but the human has to pick the object out of the bin or off the shelf, because that’s still too difficult. but, at the same time, would you make a robot that is accurate eno ugh to be able to pick pretty much any object within a very wide variety of objects that you can buy? that would, at a stroke, eliminate 3 or 4 million jobs? there's an interesting story that e.m. forster wrote, where everyone is entirely machine de pendent. the story is really about the fact that if you hand over the management of your civilization to machines, you then lose the incentive to understand it yourself or to teach the next generation how to understand it. you can see “wall -e” actually as a modern version, where everyone is enfeebled and infantilized by the machine, and that hasn’t been possible up to now. we put a lot of our civilization into books, but the books can’t run it for us. and so we always have to teach the next generatio n. if you work it out, it’s about a trillion person years of teaching and learning and an unbroken chain that goes back tens of thousands of generations. what happens if that chain breaks? i think that’s something we have to understand as ai moves f orward. the actual date of arrival of general purpose ai — you’re not going to be able to pinpoint, it isn’t a single day. it’s also not the case that it’s all or nothing. the impact is going to be increasing. so with every advance in ai, it significantly expands the range of tasks. so in that sense, i think most experts say by the end of the century, we’re very, very likely to have general purpose ai. the median is something around 2045. i'm a little more on the conservative side. i think the problem is harder than we think. i like what john mcafee, he was one of the founders of ai, when he was asked this question, he said, somewhere between five and 500 years. and we're going to need, i think, several einsteins to make it happen.\n"

      "when i was seven years old and my sister was just five years old, we were playing on top of a bunk bed. i was two years older than my sister at the time -- i mean, i'm two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything t hat i wanted to do, and i wanted to play war. so we were up on top of our bunk beds. and on one side of the bunk bed, i had put out all of my g.i. joe soldiers and weaponry. and on the other side were all my sister's my little ponies ready for a cavalry ch arge. there are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon, but since my sister is not here with us today, let me tell you the true story -- which is my sister's a little on the clumsy side. somehow, without any help or push from her older brother at all, amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor. i nervously peered over the side of the bed to see wh at had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground. i was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and i played as safely and as quietly as possib le. and seeing as how i had accidentally broken amy's arm just one week before heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet, for which i have yet to be tha nked, i was trying as hard as i could -- she didn't even see it coming -- i was trying hard to be on my best behavior. and i saw my sister's face, this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and wake my parents f rom the long winter's nap for which they had settled. so i did the only thing my frantic seven year -old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy. and if you have children, you've seen this hundreds of times. i said, \"amy, wait. don't cry. did you see how you landed? no human lands on all fours like that. amy, i think this means you're a unicorn.\" now, that was cheating, because there was nothing she would want more than not to be amy the hurt five year -old little sister, but am y the special unicorn. of course, this option was open to her brain at no point in the past. and you could see how my poor, manipulated sister faced conflict, as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced, or contemplating her new -found identity as a unicorn. and the latter won. instead of crying or ceasing our play, instead of waking my parents, with all the negative consequences for me, a smile spread across her face and she scrambled back up onto the bunk bed with al l the grace of a baby unicorn with one broken leg. what we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven -- we had no idea at the time -- was was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain. we had stumbled across so mething called positive psychology, which is the reason i'm here today and the reason that i wake up every morning. when i started talking about this research outside of academia, with companies and schools, the first thing they said to never do is to start with a graph. the first thing i want to do is start with a graph. this graph looks boring, but it is the reason i get excited and wake up every morning. and this graph doesn't even mean anything; it' s fake data. what we found is if i got this data studying you, i would be thrilled, because there's a trend there, and that means that i can get published, which is all that really matters. there is one weird red dot above the curve, there's one weirdo in the room -- i know w ho you are, i saw you earlier -- that's no problem. that's no problem, as most of you know, because i can just delete that dot. i can delete that dot because that's clearly a measurement error. and we know that's a measurement error because it's messing up my data. so one of the first things we teach people in economics, statistics, business and psychology courses is how, in a statistically valid way, do we eliminate the weirdos. how do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the l ine of best fit? which is fantastic if i'm trying to find out how many advil the average person should be taking -- two. but if i'm interested in your potential, or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity, we're creating the cult of th e average with science. if i asked a question like, \"how fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom?\" scientists change the answer to \"how fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom?\" and we tailor the class towards the average. if you fall below the average, then psychologists get thrilled, because that means you're depressed or have a disorder, or hopefully both. we're hoping for both because our business model is, if you come into a therapy session with one problem, we want to make sure you leave knowing you have ten, so you keep coming back. we'll go back into your childhood if necessary, but eventually we want to make you normal again. but normal is merely average. and positive psychology posits that if we study what i s merely average, we will remain merely average. then instead of deleting those positive outliers, what i intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say, why? why are some of you high above the curve in terms of intellectual, athletic, musical ability, creativity, energy levels, resiliency in the face of challenge, sense of humor? whatever it is, instead of deleting you, what i want to do is study you. because maybe we can glean information, not just how to move people up to the average, b ut move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide. the reason this graph is important to me is, on the news, the majority of the information is not positive. in fact it's negative. most of it's about murder, corruption, diseases, natural disasters. and very quickly, my brain starts to think that's the accu rate ratio of negative to positive in the world. this creates \"the medical school syndrome.\" during the first year of medical training, as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases, suddenly you realize you have all of them. i have a brother in -law named bobo, which is a whole other story. bobo married amy the unicorn. bobo called me on the phone from yale medical school, and bobo said, \"shawn, i have leprosy.\" whic h, even at yale, is extraordinarily rare. but i had no idea how to console poor bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause. we're finding it's not necessarily the reality that shapes us, but the lens through w hich your brain views the world that shapes your reality. and if we can change the lens, not only can we change your happiness, we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time. i applied to harvard on a dare. i didn't ex pect to get in, and my family had no money for college. when i got a military scholarship two weeks later, they let me go. something that wasn't even a possibility became a reality. i assumed everyone there would see it as a privilege as well, that they'd be excited to be there. even in a classroom full of people smarter than you, i felt you'd be happy just to be in that classroom. but what i found is, while some people experience that, when i graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight year s living in the dorms with the students -- harvard asked me to; i wasn't that guy. i was an officer to counsel students through the difficult four years. and in my research and my teaching, i found that these students, no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school, two weeks later their brains were focused, not on the privilege of being there, nor on their philosophy or physics, but on the competition, the workload, the hassles, stresses, complaints. when i first went in there, i walked into the freshmen dining hall, which is where my friends from waco, texas, which is where i grew up -- i know some of you know this. when they'd visit, they'd look around, and say, \"this dining hall looks like something out of hogwart's.\" it does, because that was hogwart's and that's harvard. and when they see this, they say, \"why do you waste your time studying happiness at harvard? what does a harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about?\" embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness. because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels, when in reality, if i know everything about your external world, i can only predict 10% of your long -term happiness. 90 percent of your long -term happiness is predicted not by the e xternal world, but by the way your brain processes the world. and if we change it, if we change our formula for happiness and success, we can change the way that we can then affect reality. what we found is that only 25% of job successes are predicted by i q, 75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels, your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat. i talked to a new england boarding school, probably the most prestigious one, and they sa id, \"we already know that. so every year, instead of just teaching our students, we have a wellness week. and we're so excited. monday night we have the world's leading expert will speak about adolescent depression. tuesday night it's school violence and b ullying. wednesday night is eating disorders. thursday night is illicit drug use. and friday night we're trying to decide between risky sex or happiness.\" i said, \"that's most people's friday nights.\" which i'm glad you liked, but they did not like that at all. silence on the phone. and into the silence, i said, \"i'd be happy to speak at your school, but that's not a wellness week, that's a sickness week. you've outlined all the negative th ings that can happen, but not talked about the positive.\" the absence of disease is not health. here's how we get to health: we need to reverse the formula for happiness and success. in the last three years, i've traveled to 45 countries, working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn. an d i found that most companies and schools follow a formula for success, which is this: if i work harder, i'll be more successful. and if i'm more successful, then i'll be happier. that undergirds most of our parenting and managing styles, the way that we motivate our behavior. and the problem is it's scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons. every time your brain has a success, you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like. you got good grades, now you have to get better grades , you got into a good school and after you get into a better one, you got a good job, now you have to get a better job, you hit your sales target, we're going to change it. and if happiness is on the opposite side of success, your brain never gets there. w e've pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon, as a society. and that's because we think we have to be successful, then we'll be happier. but our brains work in the opposite order. if you can raise somebody's level of positivity in the present, then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage, which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than at negative, neutral or stressed. your intelligence rises, your creativity rises, your energy levels rise. in fact, we've found that every single business outcome improves. your brain at positive is 31% more productive than your brain at negative, neutral or stressed. you're 37% better at sales. doctors are 19 percent faster, more accurate at coming up with the correct diagn osis when positive instead of negative, neutral or stressed. which means we can reverse the formula. if we can find a way of becoming positive in the present, then our brains work even more successfully as we're able to work harder, faster and more intelligently. we need to be able to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of. because dopamine, which floods into your system when you're positive, has two functions. not only does it make you happier, it turns o n all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way. we've found there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive. in just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a r ow, we can actually rewire your brain, allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully. we've done these things in research now in every company that i've worked with, getting them to write down three new things that they're grateful for for 21 days in a row, three new things each day. and at the end of that, their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world not for the negative, but for the positive first. journaling about one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it. exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters. we find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural adhd that we've been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allow s our brains to focus on the task at hand. and finally, random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness. we get people, when they open up their inbox, to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their support network. and by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies, what we've found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success, and in doing so, not only create ripples of positivity, but a real revolution. thank you very much.\n"

      "will also be able to predict its adult size, how much exercise it will need, food requirements, and so on. Plus, you will receive certiﬁcation of the dog’s lineage, essential if you want to enter it into dog shows.

      "DO YOU NEED?\n",
      "The amount of space you need \n",
      "will depend both on the size and \n",
      "age of the dog you acquire and on the amount of exercise it receives. A mid-sized energetic dog that gets out a lot may be content simply to lounge around when indoors. \n",
      "SPRINGING INTO ACTION \n",
      "Springer Spaniels require an enormous amount of exercise and space, so a small home is not for them.LONG These coats need more care than other coat types. Long coats can mask issues such as injuries or weight problems, so be alert to these when grooming your dog.\n",
      "SMOOTH The easiest of all the  coat types, smooth coats require little equipment other than a comb and a soft brush. They should not be bathed too often because this washes away their natural oils.WIRY These coats need a lot of combing or they will get matted. Clipping  or stripping every 6–8 weeks is also an option.CURLY Every couple of months, these nonmolting coats need a clip and a bath. Excess hair in the ears should be plucked.\n",

      "I’ve always gardened in places where there were more people than cows or tractors. Garden beds in these places were never as big as I’d planned and were soon devoured by just a few plants. So they filled themselves up and I tried to do things differently.I wish I could say that I had a stroke of genius or like some crazed, brilliant, horticultural Einstein I began sketching structural masterpieces on the back of napkins. No, the truth is that I’m extremely average. I learned about plants, soil, and microclimates by trying, failing, and finally succeeding. I still fail, and I still succeed—gardening is cool like that.I gleaned the lion’s share of any information I have from the generous gardeners I’ve met along the way. The clever ideas in this book are no exception. We gardeners are zealous in our efforts to share seeds, cuttings, stories, recipes, and advice.After all, the whole point  of gardening is to grow things, and a gardener’s personal growth is per -\n",
      "haps the most important. The only way I know for that to happen is to question, attempt, discover, and share. Gardeners are excellent at these things.So come on in and see what the creative gardening folk all over this country have come up with so that everyone can plant, grow, and harvest crops in their own backyard no matter where they reside.\n",
      "How This Book Is Organized\n",
      "Vertical Vegetable Gardening  is divided into four parts:\n",
      "Part 1, The Beauty and Bounty of Vertical Gardening, explains why vertical vegetable gardening is one of the smartest gardening techniques around, and what makes it so versatile. Less work, less weeding, fewer pests, less time, less money, and more produce is what a vertical vegetable garden has to offer you. In this part I explore the advantages to gardening vertically, discuss how plants climb and what structures work well, and give advice for where to locate your garden. I also tell you how to frame a simple garden bed and create other structures from scratch, and discuss creative ways to repurpose items you may already have around your house.Part 2, The Basics: Soil and Seed, explores the fundamentals of gardening: defining soil, compost, and amendments. I include directions for traditional composting as well as composting directly in a bed (the compost sandwich). I explain warm- and cool-season vegetables and which seeds can be planted directly into the garden bed and which you may want to start indoors first. I also discuss how to start seeds and take cuttings so that you may never have to buy another plant. If you’re curious about the differences between heirloom, open-pollinated, and hybrid seeds, I’ve got that covered in this section, too.Vertical Vegetable Gardeningxiv\n",
      "h\n",
      "Part 3, Tending the Vertical Vegetable Garden, is all about the day-to-day workings of your vertical vegetable garden. Feeding and watering are clearly important for successful gardening, but there are a lot of questions that can come with it. Part 3 answers these questions, with details on the essentials of plant and soil nurturing. You find information on mulching, organic amendments, crop rotation, and pruning. I also explain organic and least-toxic pest control, and if you have to break out the big guns, I tell you how to handle those chemical products safely.Part 4, Vegetables and Fruit That Enjoy Growing Up, is dedicated to the vegetables, herbs, fruits, and berries that thrive in a vertical setting. Each plant profile discusses planting, tending, harvesting, and the best-bet varieties, so you can choose what works best for you.\n",

      "Throughout the book, you’ll find the following sidebars that highlight information I want to be sure you’ll catch:The longer, individually titled sidebars add further thought on a topic within that section.

      "which techniques or plant varieties seem to work extremely well in a particular situation. Best Bets are based on what is working for a large group of seasoned gardeners. That’s not to say that it’s the “end all” or “the answers of answers.”Best Bets are meant to guide you to either a situation or plant that many gardeners find superior. That said, I hope that you’re like me and enjoy letting the experimenter inside you come out to play once in a while. If you have an idea or an instinct about something, I encourage you to go for it, and if it works well, to share your discovery with other gardeners.\n",
      "Acknowledgments\n",
      "No matter how many times I’m in the middle of a book, it always feels like the first time. I want to thank my extremely patient editor, Tom Stevens, for reminding me that it isn’t (the first time). Thank you to my agent, Marilyn Allen, for her guidance and friendship.xv\n",

      "yards. We’ve been given undisputable proof that fresh, homegrown food is tastier, healthier, and cheaper than purchasing it from a local grocery store.It’s easy to see why gardeners are touting the brilliance of getting back to basics and growing at least some of their own produce. But for those with what seems like precious little space, it feels like an unrealistic endeavor. I mean, how much food can you really get from an urban 4' × 4' spot of earth? Or a half barrel?The technical answer will vary, because you have to take into consideration the plant species, vari -\n",

      "Naturally, the first reason that gardening vertically makes sense is that many of us are quite limited as far as gardening space. We have what’s commonly referred to as small-space gardens and would like to get the most out of every square inch of soil. In fact, when I lived in the suburbs, that’s exactly why I started gardening vertically: I had limited places around my home to plant a vegetable garden and wanted a decent-sized harvest.Today, I live on 5 acres and I can honestly tell you that I grow more vegetables vertically than I ever did when I had much less land. The truth is that the space above the soil is underused as a growing resource, and it offers some surprising benefits to the gardener.

But, it isn’t the only good reason by a long shot. You may have plenty of room to plant a garden, but you would like to take advantage of any number of compelling reasons to add vertical components.\n",
      "Less Time and Work\n",
      "This reason alone is enough to keep my interest. Between raising kids, working, keeping house (and yard), paying bills, cooking meals, caring for pets, and volunteering, I lead a very full life, and my guess is that you do, too. Gardening and growing fresh food is something that I strongly believe in and have no intentions of cutting out.The question is, how many things can I grow? Most of us keep up a busy daily pace just to stay afloat, so it may feel like one potted pepper plant is all you can manage. This is the beauty of growing vertically—the time commitment is very little compared to what’s considered a horizontal garden bed. Of course, how much time depends on how many vertical gardens you’re tending. I should point out that even if you choose to have a large garden of vertical veggies, you’ll still get twice as much done for your vertical plants as you would their horizontally grown counterparts. This is because there’s very little soil for you to deal with, especially if your veggies are in a con -\n",

Harvesting is a quick endeavor when fruit is at eye level and can be easily seen and picked.In short, your back and knees will thank you for adopting an upward gardening plan! Each of these factors also make vertical gardening the perfect method for those with physical limitations, as well. Gardeners in wheelchairs or with other physical challenges find that growing veggies up makes their hobby much easier—or perhaps even possible.\n",
      "Less Money\n",
      "Personally, this is a deal-maker for me. It’s a tough economy, right? If you intend to create raised garden beds, growing plants vertically will save you money on purchasing soil because you won’t need to build large rectangular beds. In fact, you’ll be able to get away with obtaining just enough soil for the roots of the plants. When you garden with large, horizontal ones, you’re providing fresh soil for the vines that simply rest on the soil as they sprawl; soil that’s basically wasted.The same principle applies to compost. Compost is the best thing you can do for your garden and whether you have your own compost piles going or plan to purchase this important amendment, it’ll go a lot farther when you’re adding it only to the area that really needs it—the plant roots.Part 1: The Beauty and Bounty of Vertical Gardening6\n",

      "Smaller beds mean a smaller growing surface. Combine this with a root delivery water system (such as a drip system) and rich, loamy soil to retain moisture, and you’ll have a smaller water bill, too.\n",
      "Fewer Weeds, Pests, and Diseases\n",
      "One of the best perks of vertical gardening is that you’ll have very few weeds sprouting up and even when they do rear their ugly heads, they can all be yanked out in minutes. With horizontal beds you’re also weeding all of the bare soil areas in-between the plants so that they don’t take over the garden as they mature. With vertical gardening you’re working with much less soil surface, and many times you’re starting with bagged soils that are weed-free from the outset.Plants grown vertically up (such as trellising) or vertically down (such as hanging baskets) enjoy exceptional air circulation, much more so than their ground-dwelling counterparts. More air circu -\n",
      "lation around the plant foliage means less trouble with pests and disease, which means a stronger plant that will produce more unblemished fruit. And much, much less food waste due to rotting.When plants are grown horizontally, they’re often on soil that’s damp and warm from the leaf cover. This exposes the plants unnecessarily to soil-borne diseases. Crops grown on a support have much fewer problems with rot, and therefore, waste. By allowing plants to grow up instead of out, you also limit their physical contact to neighboring plants. This is a major plus as plant diseases are readily transmitted through physical foliage contact.\n",
      "And More … Is More\n",
      "If these advantages aren’t enough to get you scrambling for fencing and trellises, this just might push you over the edge: a bigger bounty. That’s right, gardening vertically can actually increase your vegetable production. This increase in production is due to the plants and veggies receiving better air circulation and sunlight, which help maintain healthy foliage. Healthy plants with fewer pests and disease offer bigger yields, yet in a smaller space.Chapter 1: The Vertical Advantage7\n",
      "h\n",
      "If you’re growing a vining plant such as pole beans or squash up a vertical structure such as a trellis or another free-standing support, remember you usually have two sides of that support to work with. Voila! Double the production in the same amount of space.Grown vertically, ripe veggies have a much better chance of being spotted by the gardener. One obvious advantage is that you don’t accidentally pass one up only to spot it at a later date—after it’s past its prime for the kitchen. But another good reason to harvest vegetables when they’re ripe, but not overripe, is because for many plants an overripe fruit is a signal to halt production. Cucumbers, for example, will produce like mad until one or two of the fruits becomes overripe and left on the vine. At that point, as far as the plant is concerned, it has met its goal by producing fruit that contains mature seeds—ready for the next generation of cucumbers. Thus, production comes to a full stop. When the not-fully-mature-but-mature-enough-for-dinner fruit is popped off the vine, the plant keeps trying by maintaining production.Something else less tangible plays into the higher yield and it has everything to do with your basic mind-set. Because vertically grown vegetables are easier to maintain (less time, less energy) you tend to not feel overwhelmed by a mid-summer, fully mature garden—and you actually tend it more. A little TLC goes a long way toward high production.You’ll also find that by growing vegetables up, you’ll be able to fit more varieties into a smaller space.\n",
      "Vertical Is Versatile\n",
      "You can get creative with the vertical gardening technique by tapping into the unique versatility this style offers. Vining plants can take full advantage of the situation by reaching as high as they’d like for the sun, never running out of light (or room) like they can when grown horizontally.As a bonus, vegetables that wilt in the blazing sun, such as lettuce, can be planted in at the base of a sun-worshipping climber like pole beans and relax in the shade. Veggies climbing up a vertical structure will also act as a windbreak for more delicate or young plants.Other less obvious advantages of growing up instead of out are hiding or disguising a view. Camouflage a swimming pool pump or an open compost pile with your vertical garden. An air-conditioning unit or the place where the garbage cans are stored benefit from a vertical garden wall. Your plants can soften the view of the chain-link fence and also act as a privacy screen for your home. Remember, if those plants happen to be annuals (as many veggies are) then you’ll only have a living screen for one season.Part 1: The Beauty and Bounty of Vertical Gardening8\n",

Approximately 3 hours or less of sun a day is referred to as full shade. There may be some direct or dappled sun there for a while, but when there’s less than 3 hours, it’s considered full shade. The best plants for this area are those that will thrive in the shade as opposed to those that can take part shade. Most veggies and herbs won’t do well here.Part shade. Part shade receives 4 to 6 hours of sun a day, either direct or dappled. You’ll often find great morning sun here; however, by lunchtime (or soon after) the area is shaded. You’ll also find this under open-branched trees or trees that are trimmed high, which allows good light.\n",

      "So where is the full sun in your yard? I’m guessing that you said, “on the southern side of my house.” Theoretically, you’re correct. But, in reality, you might also have structures such as another building, tall trees, or fencing that’s shading an otherwise sunny spot. No matter what kind of gardening you do, it’s a good idea to get personalized information about the space that you’ll be planting.This includes one of the most important aspects: where you can find full sun. You can see how extra information can be useful to a vegetable gardener in particular. Let me be clear: you won’t always want full sun. Some plants such as lettuce won’t tolerate full sun for very long.Finding the full sun areas in your yard or garden answers more than just one question. From there you’ll understand what’s happening in the areas surrounding the hottest spots.One of the easiest techniques for finding full sun that I’ve come across over the years is one I’ve christened the “Caveman Sun Blueprint.” It creates a very basic guide, but it remains my favorite to this day. All that is necessary to make a Caveman Sun Blueprint of your yard is paper, a pencil, and some time—specific time.While I wouldn’t hesitate to create this blueprint of my yard at any time, the best time would be in the spring on a day of blue skies (no clouds).

This is the place in your yard (or garden) that receives the most sun during the day. It’s prime real estate for tomatoes, pumpkins, melons, peppers, beans, etc.This rough-yet-handy drawing is certainly accurate as far as where your particular yard (or area of the yard) has the most sun. However, it doesn’t tell the full story. For instance, it doesn’t tell you how long that sunny spot stays sunny, right? So that place on your blueprint where all three circles intersect may only have that sun for a few hours each day.In this case, even your brightest place may not be enough for those veggies and fruits that need  6 to 8 hours of a good sun-drenching. The simplest way I have found to figure it out is just to glance out the window every hour and log how many hours the sun shines on that space. Do this on the same day that you’re creating your Caveman Sun Blueprint—you’re committed to a few hours anyway.Chapter 1: The Vertical Advantage11\n",

      "Growing zones are sometimes touted as a very big deal in the gardening world. I’m going to tell you up front that I’m not overly zone-focused. Still, one must start somewhere and I have to agree that it’s a good place to begin. What kind of gardener would I be if I didn’t explain zones and why they’re good as a basic, general guide? Just remember that like everything worthwhile in life, there’s so much more. Let’s get to the why, what, and how of growing zones—and then I’ll tell you why your place is completely unique and unlike anywhere else on this map.\n",
      "The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has growing zones outlined and numbered on a Zone Hardiness Map. The numbers on the map reflect the lowest temperatures in a given area. Plants are assigned numbers according to the lowest temperature they’ll tolerate and then you cross-reference them with the map numbers. In this way, you’ll have a fairly good idea which plants can live in your yard and not freeze to death.Hardiness numbers for plant varieties can be found in plant and gardening books, on seed packets, or on the plant’s container. If the container isn’t marked, there should be a plant tag tucked into it somewhere.\n",
      "Part 1: The Beauty and Bounty of Vertical Gardening12\n",
      "h\n",
      "You may have heard that the zone map is only helpful for planting perennial plants, trees, and shrubs. It makes sense because the map is showing the lowest temperatures, which are obviously in the winter months. Some suggest that the map is moot when discussing vegetables since most of them are treated as annuals. All you really need is the right amount of warm days for that vegetable variety to fruit and be harvested.Still, I think that it makes sense to have some basic ideas about where your garden stands, and the zone map is the first place to start. Your zone number comes in handy for describing your general area to other nonlocal gardeners and, of course, most vegetable gardeners will end up growing fruits (which are usually perennials) at some point, as well as ornamental plants.It’s not hard to find your zone number. In fact, online, there are several sites where you can type in your zip code and the zone number is generated in nanoseconds: planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/Default.aspx. If you happen to have a couple of gardening questions, you can get all the local information that you need by contacting the Master Gardeners at your local Cooperative Extension office.If you’re looking at a printed map, there are some versions where you’ll notice that each zone is divided even further into A and B regions. This breakdown reflects a 10° difference between zones that are otherwise very close in temperatures. Also, be aware of the date on the map; the USDA put a brand-spanking new one out in 2012.\n",

But you have to realize that these maps rarely line up. For instance, on the Sunset map your area may be a solid zone 7, while on the USDA map, you’ll be a 9a. Don’t let any of this throw you, though. It’s not a deal-breaker if you’re still confused.\n",
      "The Magic of Microclimates\n",
      "This is where I explain that your garden is special and no one else’s climate is exactly like yours—even if it’s in your neighborhood. As I hinted at earlier, the USDA growing zones are general guidelines that are basically accurate. However, no map can guess at the specific microclimate that’s around your city, neighborhood, or yard.Chapter 1: The Vertical Advantage13\n",
      "h\n",
      "So, what exactly are microclimates? They’re specific, local atmospheric areas where the climate differs from the larger, surrounding area (such as the numbers of USDA zones). Your general zone is affected by individual circumstances, be it natural (such as wind) or man-made (such as the southern side of your home). These are your microclimates—and you can play with them.Think of microclimates as zones-within-zones. Personally, I think this is where gardening gets fun and takes on a life of its own (so to speak). Because, technically, you may not be able to control the weather; but you can manipulate and adjust—often significantly—your growing zone by using (and making) your unique microclimate.For instance, a friend may have told you that a certain plant variety doesn’t survive the heavy winter frosts in the area. It may be confusing when that same plant is surviving winters just fine in your yard. If your zone isn’t acting as your zone “should” chances are that you’ve planted it in the right microclimate. Maybe it’s in a bed against a wall that has a southern exposure. That side may stay just warm enough to avoid a killing freeze.\n",
      "Naturally Occurring Microclimates\n",
      "Topography plays a major roll in creating microclimates. If your garden is on top of a hill, it’s going to get more wind than one situated lower. Wind is very drying to both the soil and the plants, so choose varieties accordingly, or adjust your watering schedule. Drought-tolerant plant species would do well here, or those that can tolerate a windy beating.Are you gardening in a valley? Frost is more of an issue in valleys than at higher elevations because cold air is heavier than warm air and settles in the basin. Plants that like moisture will do best here.Which side of the hill you’re on makes a difference, as well. A northern slope receives the sunshine last and is slower to warm up. While the south-facing slope warms up faster, it can be a mixed blessing. If a late frost hits spring-blooming plants, they could suffer a setback. Other microclimate factors are rainfall, soil type, and large bodies of water. Lakes, rivers, and oceans will moderate the air temperatures of any nearby inland areas.\n",
      "Manipulating Your Microclimates\n",

      "Gardeners can take advantage of the very things that would otherwise seem to be in the way: walls, houses, and neighboring buildings. Permanent structures can have a huge effect on the immediate area surrounding them. Buildings can act as wind barriers or conversely, create wind tunnels.Walls made of brick, stone, cement, or stucco will absorb heat and radiate it during the cool night hours. Walls not only hold heat effectively, but they can also provide shelter and be a protective windbreak for plants.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "If you’re using the side of your house or a wall to grow sun-worshipping vegetables, remember to use any wall but the north-facing one, as they won’t get enough sun there to produce well. A southern exposure sees the longest hours of sun; a west wall will get the intense afternoon sun; the east wall will have morning sun, and a (true) northern wall will receive no direct sun.\n",
      "Using the sun’s exposure can also be the difference between a perennial plant wintering-over or not—even if it isn’t supposed to survive the cold months in your zone. Bougainvilleas, for example, don’t usually make it through Northern California winters like they do in Southern California. But I’ve seen bougainvilleas that are alive and well in Northern California because they were planted against a wall with a southern exposure.So if you’re planting heat-loving veggies, be sure to plant them on the south side of your house—or any other type of wall. A word of warning about using a southern exposure as a microclimate: the sunniest side can also be the most drastic side for perennial plants because of fluctuating tempera-tures (think: a cycle of freezing and thawing).Conversely, if you’re looking for a cooler place, perhaps for lettuce, then go for the north side. The north side of your house might also be the best place for early flowering fruit trees like cherries and peaches. A late spring frost will set fruit production back, and the idea here is that if fruit trees are planted where there’s a northern exposure, it can help suspend blossoming until the frost date has passed.By the way, because morning sun is gentler than the sunshine throughout the rest of the day, plant tender plants on the eastern side of any structure. Save the brilliant west side for your sun-worshipping melons and pumpkins.Although we tend to think of a southern exposure as a hot spot, it isn’t always the sizzling area that it could be when there’s a structure such as a neighboring building or large tree situated between your planting space and the sun—and there we have yet another microclimate. This is fun, right?Consider too that walls have a downwind and an upwind side. Use this to your advantage by remembering the upwind side is the right place for water-loving plants as it’s going to receive more Chapter 1: The Vertical Advantage15\n",

      "Garden Structures as Microclimates\n",
      "If you’ve used all the natural microelements around your home, as well as the permanent man-made structures such as buildings and walls, you can always practice a little climate control by creating it with your own hands. There’s no end to the garden elements you can create.Cold frames and hoop houses. Think of cold frames and hoop houses as very short green houses that, as a rule, don’t have any heat source. They’re most widely used for getting a head start on vegetables in the spring or to extend the growing season beyond summer and into the fall or even winter. In fact, in climates with mild winters, some cool-weather crops (such as kale or lettuce) can be grown all winter long in a hoop house or cold frame.\n",
      "A cold frame extends the growing season so you can plant earlier and harvest longer.\n",
      "The difference between cold frames and hoop houses has more to do with the construction than the function. Cold frames are built as framed, box-type structures that have no bottom. They usually have a lid or door on the top, which can be raised to different levels. To take full advantage of the sun, the lid is made of glass or clear plastic. This allows for excellent heat collection while keeping frost off the plants at the same time.\n",
      "You can also use cold frames to toughen up (harden off) vegetable seedlings that started their lives under lights indoors. It’s the go-between place for baby plants from the protective house to the exposed garden bed.\n",

Last, here’s where you can see the looseness of the terminology. Greenhouses are often constructed of hoops and plastic (complete with door) and may be referred to as hoop houses or greenhouses—either moniker is fine.

      "Now we’ve come to the ultimate in climate control: the greenhouse. If you can get your hands on a greenhouse (any greenhouse) you’ll be all the better for it. Heating inside the greenhouse is preferred to keep plants alive through the winter. Don’t worry about heat, though; greenhouses are used successfully even when they’re not heated—I’ve used a “cold” greenhouse (without heat) for many years. But when there is a heat source, a greenhouse offers the gardener incredible versatility.Even those without artificially heating can have some temperature regulation, from making use of automatic vent openers to let hot air out and fresh air in, to attaching bubble wrap to the inside for winter insulation.The first image that may pop into your head when you hear the word “greenhouse” is the hothouse type filled with fancy tropicals.

      "If you’re not completely satisfied with the information you’ve gathered through your own research, there are gardening resources and experts all around you who are more than willing to lend you a hand.My favorite resource for consulting about plant varieties, growing zone questions, and pest or disease troubleshooting is the Master Gardeners office. Master Gardeners are graduates of a volunteer program (Extension Master Gardener Program) who are trained to advise and educate the public on gardening and home agriculture. Here in the United States, they’re affiliated with the land-grant university and the Cooperative Extension offices. They receive a thorough gardening education and because they have access to university materials, are extremely efficient researchers. They’re truly your best bet, and can be reached directly through the Cooperative Extension office in your county.My next favorite resources are local nurseries and garden centers. What’s the difference between nurseries and garden centers? I admit that the terms are often used interchangeably, but there’s technically a difference. Nurseries actually grow plants that might be directly sold to the public, landscapers, and garden centers. Sometimes nurseries sell to all three, and they may have some other garden products for sale, too. Garden centers order the plants that they sell to the public Chapter 1: The Vertical Advantage21\n",

It can be a fine line, but a nursery’s primary focus is to grow plants.

      "Gone are the days when only those with a giant square of land, complete with neatly plowed rows and engine-powered machinery, grew their own food crops. As people moved closer together—deeper into suburban and urban areas—those who were determined found a way to have fresh, homegrown (and chemical-free) food for their kitchen tables. They actually found many ways—and they did so with gusto.Those who were handy with wood and saws found endless ways to create support structures for their vining crops. Recycle hobbyists collected discarded items and grew vertically challenged plants in the most unlikely containers. Stories spread about people who were growing enough crops in their own backyards to supplement their family’s meals all summer—and through some of the winter if they happened to also be canning and freezing their bounty.It turns out that one of the most beloved and successful crop-producing techniques is vertical gardening. Traditional structures such as boundary fences, trellises, lattice, arbors, and obelisks were gardeners’ natural first choice for growing vining vegetable crops. After that, things only got better. Companies saw such an interest in small-space gardening that they developed containers and structures to help gardeners’ endeavors to grow food anywhere at any time. Garden products available now range from planters, hangers, and containers to instant garden beds, stands, and pockets, and transportable trellises.The first thing I talk about in this chapter is how  vegetables (and other plants) climb.

Twining plants will wrap their stems around anything that stands still long enough. They twine either clockwise or counterclockwise depending on the species.Some climbers have curly little side shoots off of their stems called tendrils. Tendrils reach out and wrap themselves around the nearest support, too. It’s simply two methods of achieving the same end. Climbing veggies and fruit are the right produce for growing against structures that are out-fitted with a material such as a chain-link fence, railing, rope, netting, or wire mesh.\n",

      "Boundary Fences\n",
      "The fencing that separates your property from your neighbor’s is a logical place to start when planning on gardening up. One way to utilize solid, wood-paneled fencing is by attaching hanging baskets, pots, and other growing containers to it. With this type of vertical garden, this wouldn’t be about vegetables that climb, it would be about veggies and fruit that grow well in containers such as lettuce, radishes, strawberries, herbs, and the like.Part 1: The Beauty and Bounty of Vertical Gardening26\n",

      "A collection of garden pots can be mounted on a wall or fence, which not only takes advantage of the vertical space on the fence, but also frees up the ground beneath for, well … more pots. There are many ways to get flower pots up onto a fence or perhaps a deck rail. One way is to slide your flower pots into basket-shaped wire mounts. The wire baskets have a hook that fits right over a fence or railing. Special wall clips can be screwed into a wall or fence and then the pot is simply attached to the clips. Also on the market are circular wall sconces that are attached to the wall; the flower pot slips right into the metal ring. Other great products are wire grid (like a cattle panel), which comes with pre-attached circular holders; the entire grid is then mounted onto the wall.Some companies offer special containers that are specially made for wall plantings. These pots or baskets are flat on one side so that they lie flush against the surface. They come in ceramic, plastic, terra cotta, and iron.Deck rail planters are typically mounted in one of three ways: attached directly to a flat, wood rail; as a hanging planter with an arm over the rail; or as a sleeve in which the bottom of the planter “fits” over the flat rail. Variety abounds here, too, with plastic, wood, and iron basket types.Wood fencing made with flat panels doesn’t offer anything for climbing veggies to “grab” in order to hoist themselves up, but attaching a trellis or other grid-type material is a game-changer. Now, the tendrils and twiners have all the support they need. (See Chapter 4 for more about support structures.)Some yards are surrounded by low, picket-type fencing. Fences that are constructed with both vertical and horizontal materials can be used as a home for climbing veggies. Hanging planters can also be secured to the top of this type of fence and still be within the gardener’s reach.Chain-link fencing, while technically ugly, turns out to be undeniably useful as a vertical garden structure. It’s a climbing plant’s dream. Not to mention that when something with full foliage is planted against it, it’s transformed into an attractive “solid” wall.

Peruse any garden center, nursery, lumberyard, or hardware store and you’ll find trellises with rectangle, square, and fan shapes, as well as the traditional diamond pattern. Of course, some trellises don’t have a pattern at all.Lattice is often painted white or a blue-wash color. Many wood trellises are left unsealed and the gardener can seal or paint it themselves. The wood can also be left raw, especially if it’s made with redwood, cedar, or teak, as these woods deteriorate slowly.

Some are made of wrought iron with copper caps on top while others are made of metal with decorative scrolling running up the sides.An obelisk is the reason that I first thought it was perfectly fine to have a vegetable garden in the front yard. I’ll plant a garden on the front lawn any day of the week, but an obelisk almost makes it mandatory. Your vining plants could find nothing classier to climb.\n",

      "EarthBoxes\n",
      "At first glance, this popular product looks like any common, rectangular planter box. But it’s actually a pretty impressive little growing system in its own right. One of the interesting features is that there’s a reservoir at the bottom of the system that keeps the soil evenly moist as long as there’s water inside. A long tube runs from the bottom up past the top of the box for watering directly into the reservoir. Before you plant the box, there’s a cover that’s placed over the soil bed, which helps retain moisture, as well. You then cut holes in the cover and add your plant starts.I found that there was very little concern about keeping the plants in the box watered.

One thing is for sure, shallow-rooted lettuce takes exceptionally well to being grown in hanging baskets and other sky-high planters. It’s entirely possible to have a diverse lettuce garden suspended in mid-air.Hanging baskets come in some wonderfully unique and attractive styles. My favorites are those that are made with a wire skeleton frame and then lined with a coco material. The material acts as a barrier between the wire and the plants, keeps the soil inside, and helps retain moisture (depending on the type of liner). If you look around, you’ll find more than just the traditional bowl-shape, such as conical and oblong. Pay attention to which kind of liner you’d like if you choose a wire basket–type hanger.\n",

The initial product of this type utilized a bag that was too small for most standard tomato varieties, although one might have success with a cherry tomato variety. What do I mean by too small? Well, large tomatoes like to get their roots into soil that’s a little deeper than what is in the bag, and during hot summer months, it’s difficult to keep a decent amount of moisture in there. For some reason it also troubles me to watch the plant struggle and twist itself upward to reach for the sun.Let me be clear: I’m not saying that you can’t  grow something in this bag, but when it comes to \n",

In any case, one of the best solutions that I’ve seen for planting upside down is to create your own containers with 5-gallon buckets, which is the largest soil capacity I’ve seen yet. I’ll tell you how in Chapter 5.\n",
      "Plant Stands\n",
      "A plant stand can mean different things, and thankfully, every one of them is helpful as far as vertical gardening is concerned. The first type of stand is one built with graduating shelves or steps that holds whatever containers you decide to put on it. There’s a bazillion types in any number of heights and sizes. In fact, before you run out and purchase new ones, this is one thing that shows up at garage sales, Craigslist, and Freecycle regularly. Never get rid of a plant stand—you’re going to need it sooner or later.Another kind of plant stand is the type that has the planters built right into it. It's a free-standing unit that may have two, three, or four rectangular containers attached to it. Something like this can become an entire vertical garden unto itself. Picture a three-tiered stand with strawberries planted at the top, lettuce in the middle, and peas planted in the last container.\n",

For instance, as I talked about in Chapter 2, you might be using miniature garden “beds” such as containers like pots, rail planters, hanging baskets, or stackable containers for nonvining vegetables and fruit.On the other hand, you may be gardening in a raised bed or a traditional in-the-ground garden bed where you’ll place any upright structures for the climbing plants.Of course, container gardens can be moved around if you aren’t happy with their first positions on the porch, deck, or yard. Be sure to take some time to consider which crops you’d like to grow and how much sunlight is necessary to grow them before you build one of the more permanent raised or in-ground beds.\n",
      "The Benefits of Raised Garden Beds\n",
      "Raised garden beds are probably the greatest invention since facial tissue. You can grow vertical veggies and fruit in any bed available, whether it’s a traditional plot, prefabricated instant beds, or something that’s been recycled. You’ll notice that when gardeners plant a vertical garden from scratch, it’s often in a raised bed of some kind. Even a container or a pot is a modified raised bed.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "I’m often asked how deep I make my raised garden beds. The truth is, probably not as deep as you think. I’ve planted in beds that were 6\" all the way to 24\" and I can honestly say that I’ve never needed any bed over 12\" deep. My preference is 12\" beds for plants such as tomatoes that like to sink their roots deep, but 6\"- to 8\" beds for most other vegetables.\n",

      "Extended growing seasons. Out of all the great benefits, this one is at the top of my list. Raised beds warm up earlier than in-ground beds, which give you a jump-start on the growing season.

This also makes it easy to alter the soil for certain plants in one bed without messing with the other. Plus, it starts out weed-free!Excellent drainage and water retention. Actually, the magic here is that when you build a raised bed, you’re often adding prepared garden soil (whether it’s bagged or what-have-you). Prepared soil blended with compost typically has good tilth (porous and crumbly; resembles coffee grounds) and that means high organic matter. This soil holds water well, yet is free-draining as far as excess. So raised beds rarely become waterlogged, which gives roots room to breathe.Reduced soil compaction.  In a traditional garden bed, it’s hard to keep your feet off the soil. This \n",
      "is important because plant roots need air and busy feet compact the soil. Raised beds should be designed to let the gardeners reach to the middle of the bed from two sides, thus your feet remain outside the bed and on the path.Easier garden maintenance.

And because you don’t have to step between traditional rows, you can plant your veggies a little closer together. I’m not suggesting overcrowding your vegetables, but you can certainly plant a bit more intensively in a raised bed. Also, the leaves will shade most of the bare soil, which tends to smother out weeds—a huge plus in my book.Chapter 3: Make Your Own Bed41\n",

But there are a few things that should be considered before making your choice. Lumber is the number one choice for many gardeners, so let’s talk about wood first. Back in the day, chromated copper arsenate or CCA–treated lumber was quite popular, until someone figured out that the arsenic, chromium, and copper the wood contained was leaching into soils.Since then, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has stopped arsenic from being used in the lumber. Pressure-treated wood is now deemed to have no ill effects on people or animals and is processed in a more ecologically friendly way. Alkaline copper quaternary (ACQ), copper azole (CA), and micronized copper quaternary (MCQ) are some of the current wood treatments; arsenic was dropped from the formula.\n",

This instant garden bed comes complete with bottom liner, making a fantastic instant garden bed for patios, small yards, condos, apartments, or anyone who wants to create a little garden in minutes.Because it does drain well, I’d set it on top of a pallet if it’s being used on a wood deck or patio so the water can drain and dry freely without saturating the wood for long periods of time.

The difference here is that the Greenland Gardener doesn’t have a bottom, so this wouldn’t be the one to use on your patio or cement driveway. However, one of the nice things about a bare bottom is that while you’re adding and amending the soil that’s filling the bed, the critters of the earth (such as worms) are being called in at the same time.Any organic matter that you place in your Greenland Gardener bed will get worked by the macro- and microorganisms that are in your soil naturally—which means the soil directly beneath the bed will become better and better as time goes on.\n",

      "You’re going to love this chapter; it’s all about creation. All of the structures that you’ll find in this section are easy for anyone to assemble. Use the directions as a jumping-off point for your own imagination.I discuss various climbing supports for vining vegetables and fruit. I thought it was important to talk about climbing support options so that you can decide which one will work for you and your vertical garden. I also have thoughts about plant-tie materials for attaching climbing structures to their supports.What I want you to take away from the first sections of this chapter is that the basic support system directions can be created the same general way, but you can swap out both the climbing  and the framing material for whichever ones you’d like.I also want to give a quick reminder to flip back to Chapter 3 and reread the section titled “The Safety Speech” and the sidebar entitled “The Tools by Your Side” before you get started on a project.\n",
      "Summing Up Support\n",
      "A support system is the combination of whichever material your plants will be climbing and what- ever is holding that material in place (the frame). Before you commit to a support system (and  purchase the materials) you’ll need to consider the plants that you’re growing. In the following  sections are some thoughts on the materials that are used to create vertical support systems.\n",
      "Climbing Materials\n",
      "Lightweight climbing materials such as netting and twine are perfect for vegetables such as peas and green beans. But if you’re planning on vertical melons, you’ll want something sturdier, such  as wire panels or wood.hPart 1: The Beauty and Bounty of Vertical Gardening54\n",
      "h\n",
      "Trellis netting.  Nylon netting made specifically for trellising climbing vines is an excellent choice \n",
      "for everything but the heaviest fruit (like melons). It’ll last for several seasons and although sizes may vary, there’s always enough room to collect ripe fruit.String, jute, or twine. String, twine—whatever you have hanging around the garage or junk drawer—break it out for your garden structures. You probably already know just how versatile these items are in everyday life, and it’s no different in the garden. String it horizontally from bottom to top for light twining plants like peas and beans. Or for something with more to grab onto, weave strands horizontally as well to create netting.Baling twine.  Hay bales are often held together with colorful baling twine, as opposed to the old \n",
      "baling wire of the past. After the hay is gone, many people are left wondering how to repurpose the plastic twine left behind.Secure one end of the twine at the bottom of a support system by wrapping and tying—and then stapling it—to the frame. String it up to the top and repeat. You could also make netting out of it the same way I explained with the jute or string.Bailing twine needs to be secured at the ends—not just tied. If you tie it, the knot will hold well for a while, but will loosen fairly quickly. This is why I don’t recommend it for plant tying in the next section.Wire mesh panels (cattle or hog panels). These panels are made of galvanized welded steel rods and have square openings that vary in size. Those that are thick and galvanized are often referred to as hog or cattle panels and are my favorite metal mesh. Hog panels don’t rust, and they last \n",
      "forever. Look for them at livestock feed stores.There’s also a thin, ungalvanized version called concrete reinforcing wire, which can be found at any home improvement store. These will rust (probably in the first year), but they’re seriously cheap. A little spray paint will make you happier with them and they’re easy to move and store.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "The thickest hog panels hold heat incredibly well. If this is the climbing material you’re using, be sure to feel them during the hottest part of the day to be sure that they aren’t getting so hot that they’ll burn the new tendrils that are making their way up it. If you feel that the panels are too hot, add a shade cloth or umbrella in front of the trellis when the sun is blazing just until the plants begin to take over the panel. The leaves of the plant will cool things off after they fill in a bit.Chapter 4: DIY Structures from Scratch55\n",

      "reusable because pulling the spent vines out of those holes is a nightmare. For many vegetables, it’s a bad choice all the way around. It is simply too frail to use for something like a tomato vine cage; and for others, even if it did manage to stay upright, you can’t get your hands through the wire to reach the fruit. It’s really best to stick with supports that allow 4\" to 7\" of room for easy harvesting.All of this said, I’ve used chicken wire in the past (and will again in the future) because I often have it around, it’s an inexpensive material, and it works well for a temporary structure.Plastic poultry fencing (a.k.a. garden netting).

But as I’ve mentioned before, if I have something on hand that will work (even if just for the season) then I use it. In fact, this year I made a sandwich board A-frame (see instructions later in the chapter) and we happened to have the plastic garden netting on hand. So we attached it to the frame and are currently growing green beans up one side and cucumbers up the other. Although it’ll be a little time-consuming, I’ll more than likely pull the spent vines from the frame when the season is over.Field fencing.

      "Vegetable plants that produce heavy fruits, such as melons, cantaloupes, spaghetti squash, pump-kins, and the like, will need to have a sling of some type to support the maturing fruits.

It’s the veggies whose weight falls somewhere in between that will need a little help.There are slings commercially available; however, you’ll probably find several things around your home that would work just as well. Netting of any kind will work —bird netting, too. Also pantyhose, T-shirts, and any cotton fabric will do the trick.Just tie one end of the sling to the trellis or whatever support you’re using for that veggie. Gently slide the sling under and around the fruit and then tie the other end of the sling to the trellis. You may want to make the sling larger than the fruit is at that time.

      "Ladders\n",
      "Ladders offer a whole host of opportunities for gardening. The first one is to plant pole beans at the base of the legs and point the tendrils in the right direction.

If you’ve got this type of ladder, place runner boards that are long enough to go from one step/rung all the way through to the other side. Place the boards on all of the steps and you’ve got platforms for pots and other containers.For a traditional wooden ladder with steps only on one side, screw the same number of 2\" × 2\" boards on the other side of the ladder (directly across from the steps); then add the runner boards. You could always leave the ladder as it is and just place terra cotta pots on all of the steps.\n",

Chemicals can leach into the soil and therefore your food crops.Use a hand drill to make a dozen holes in the bottom of the drawers and add a layer of small rocks to help with drainage.

      "Soil Medium for Containers and Raised Beds\n",

      "plantings, which not only makes it hard for growing plant roots to penetrate and receive oxygen, but also inhibits good drainage and is extremely heavy.Keep in mind that potting soil is often “soil-less.” For example, instead of traditional soil particles, it may be made up of a combination of ground bark, peat, and vermiculite. Depending on the developer there may be a time release fertilizer sprinkled throughout or compost added. But don’t be surprised if there isn’t any other amendment listed on the label. This is because the soil-less mix doesn’t typically have any nutritional value (unless there’s compost or vermicompost added)—it’s basically a medium for holding roots and water. If you’re working with a potting mix, you’ll even -\n",

      "Why would you purchase soil that contains vermicompost? Vermicompost (worm castings plus com-posted materials) contains significantly more beneficial microorganisms, enzymes, humus, and plant stimulants than regular compost. Among other things, worm castings offer these nutrients in high percentages in a slow-release form along with superior soil-binding and water-retaining abilities.\n",
      "So go for the potting soil bag when planting in the smaller (the porch-type) containers—leave the “garden soil” for the raised garden beds and in-ground planting areas. Those containers that are the middle ground between containers and raised beds are the products like The Little Acre or other contained raised beds (pictured in Chapter 3). Potting soil is appropriate for these beds, but garden soil is great, too. If you choose garden soil, you can keep it on the lighter side by adding equal parts of garden soil, vermiculite, compost, and peat moss.No matter what you’re gardening in, you’ll want to amend all of these soils with some extra goodies at one point or another. Amending  is a general term that refers to improving or correcting your soil. \n",

      "Define “Great” Soil\n",
      "What is “good” garden soil anyway? For the gardener, it’s a scent and a feel. To the nose it’s deep and earthy; to the hand, it’s crumbly and fluffy. It’s high in organic matter and rich with nutrition. The physical description is a balanced blend of organic matter, clay, and sand. This garden nirvana is referred to as “loam” or as having “good tilth.”Nearly all vegetable plants thrive in loamy soil mainly because it’s loaded with organic matter (compost). With all that wiggle-room, roots penetrate easily, just enough water is retained, and excess drains easily away.Chapter 6: Garden Soil 101101\n",

      "Clay Soil\n",
      "You may be in a high-clay area (like me) where the soil can be described as dense (heavy) and hard to get a spade into, which means that plants will have the same problem with their roots. I actually don’t mind clay soils because there’s great fertility going on in there—you just have to get to it! Although the nutrition is there, the clay is locking up the nutrients that plants could be using.The key is to break up the fine clay particles and get some aeration in there by adding compost and sand. You may have run into a common clay soil “remedy” that says to simply add sand. That’s part of the solution, but not the entire recipe. If you add a bunch of sand willy-nilly to your clay, you will discover concrete. Okay, maybe not true concrete, but you’re getting a pretty good image. In order to reach a state of loam, you must add the third ingredient to the recipe, which is garden compost and maybe some peat if you’d like.\n",

Organic matter will not only bring the necessary nutrition to sandy soils, but will also bring water-holding properties. It’s hands-down one of the best things you can do for your garden or yard year-round.The beauty of gardening vertically is that because you’re not tending a lot of horizontal space, any amending that needs to be done shouldn’t be expensive or labor-intensive.

      "What Is pH and Why Should You Care?\n",
      "Knowing a bit about pH is one of those things that might come in handy at some point and it really isn’t all that hard to understand. On the most basic level, the acid and alkaline levels in the soil influence the nutrients that plants receive by making them either more available to plant roots or less available—depending on the plant species.Chemists measure these levels by using a pH scale, which is drawn on a number line that ranges from 0 to 14. The neutral (middle) point is at 7 on the scale. Tested soils that fall below 7 have higher acidity and are referred to as “sour.” Soils that test higher than 7 are more alkaline and are referred to as “sweet.”Most vegetable plants are happy as clams living in a neutral to slightly acidic soil. This is good news to those who worship compost because soils that are high in organic matter generally hover around the neutral area. By the way, another one of compost’s virtues is that it acts as a pH buffer, making plants less dependent on the pH levels in the soil.Most vegetable plants do best in a neutral to a slightly acidic pH (6–7.5). Adding compost regularly will help keep soil at a neutral place. If you find that your soil is falling over into the alkaline area, it can be lowered by adding aluminum sulfate, peat moss, conifer needles, or sawdust.If your soil is too sour (and most plants other than those like blueberries or azaleas won’t appreciate this), you can raise the pH by adding pulverized oyster shells, powdered limestone, dolomitic lime -\n",
      "stone, or sulfur. Remember, most of these pH adjusters won’t change the pH overnight no matter what soil type you have. Yes, I feel compelled to thump the compost bible once again.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "I don’t do a lot of testing and I never test my raised garden beds where I’ve added bagged soil and compost. For the most part, bagged garden soil falls close to the neutral or slightly acidic side, so testing is usually unnecessary. In my experience, I’ve found that there are more imbalances with “ground” soil than in raised beds. Even then, I don’t test in-ground soil unless I feel like things are going awry. I want to make you aware of soil testing and what that’s about, but don’t feel that you have to test before you start planting your vertical veggies.\n",
      "Testing Soil at Home\n",
      "If you’re interested in finding out where your soil falls on the pH scale, there are a few ways to go about soil testing, the simplest of which is an at-home soil testing kit. Let me say right off the bat that I’m not one of those people who’s “against” home soil tests. There’s nothing wrong with them, you just have to know that they’re not going to be very specific. That’s okay. You’ll get a general feel about what’s going on and it’s kind of fun—all scientific-like.Part 2: The Basics: Soil and Seed104\n",

      "Your local nursery or garden center will probably have soil testing kits. They look similar to pool test kits. All you do is add some of your soil, the powder that comes with the kit, and some water. Now shake it up! From there you just compare the color of the concoction with the color strips on the container. Other home tests include using simple litmus paper. This involves a soil sample, water, and a color chart to compare the dipped paper against.This is hardly the ultimate in testing, but I’ve found that it’s nice to know whether your soil pH is in the range that most veggies prefer (between 6–7.5) and that’s enough to go on. If you have a bed intended especially for tomatoes, try to bring the pH a little lower, as they prefer their soil a little on the sour side—as do potatoes.\n",

      "Compost in the Vegetable Garden\n",
      "For healthier plants, higher produce yields, and fewer garden diseases, the first place to concentrate on is the soil. The key to healthy, productive plants is soil that’s rich in organic matter. Good garden soil is about having as much organic matter in the garden bed as possible. Compost is the finished product of broken-down organic plant and animal matter. In its “finished” form, compost becomes humus. Humus makes complex nutrients in the soil easily available to plant roots. Friable soil is what you get when your soil is full of life-sustaining humus, which means that it has a full, loamy texture and crumbles easily in your hands.Compost will add any number of nutrients to the soil depending on what materials have been added to the compost pile. It adds further value by providing it with nitrogen, phosphorus, potas -\n",
      "sium, and others, plus micronutrients such as copper, iron, iodine, zinc, manganese, cobalt, boron, and molybdenum.While humus is considered the ultimate goal, you can use compost in your garden beds at any time during the composting process.

      "Obtaining Compost\n",
      "There are a number of ways to get compost to your garden beds: purchase it bagged from a nursery or garden center, obtain it from your local community gardens or a municipal composting facility, or make your own.Part 2: The Basics: Soil and Seed106\n",
      "h\n",
      "If you buy bagged compost, your best bet is to look for a certified organic label, or better yet, keep an eye out for the Mulch & Soil Council’s certification label, which lets you know for sure that the product you’re buying is free of unacceptable contaminates from materials such as CCA–treated wood. Obtaining chemical and contaminate-free soil products is especially important when it comes to growing edibles. Know what you’re looking for and you’ll find good compost on the market.If you have community gardens in your town, this is often a great place to collect compost. Some gardens make it available to the public and some prefer to keep it for community garden members. Many community gardens (if not all) have strict organic practices, so you can feel pretty secure that the materials going into the compost pile are chemical-free. The one thing you won’t know is if someone has introduced diseased plant material into the pile. That said, this is potentially a great compost resource.As far as acquiring compost from a municipal composting program (waste management company), I’m personally very leery about this practice. The first thing that seems like a no-brainer is that they collect grass clippings, and many people spread herbicides or pesticides on their lawns. These chemicals do not disappear, nor break down like organic materials, so you could simply be broad -\n",

Even then, there’s no guarantee that the public necessarily follows the policy.\n",
      "Making Your Own Compost\n",
      "What’s left? That’s right; making your own compost. Creating compost is one of the easiest and least expensive ways to add nutrients and structure to your garden soil. You could toss a stick in any direction and hit information on home composting. What I find unfortunate is that much of this information (while accurate) is unnecessarily complicated. For instance, memorizing the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio on every piece of material that you toss into your compost pile is not only overwhelming, it’s unnecessary.Truth be told; composting is about as simple as it gets. Anyone with a spare half hour and some organic material lying around can begin to reap its benefits. It’s not rocket science, there’s no magic start date on the calendar, and you don’t need expensive supplies. And you don’t need to do a lick of math, either. The key is to have some information, organic materials, and decide what kind of container or bin you’d like to use to put it all together. A perfectly adequate pile can be started in 30 minutes or less.Chapter 6: Garden Soil 101107\n",
      "h\n",
      "Every time I witness someone explaining C:N ratios to would-be composters, it makes me a little crazy. You can literally watch their eyes glaze over as a small part of their brain shuts down. Math has a tendency to do that to people. Here’s the deal: every living thing on Earth has a carbon-to-nitrogen value. The idea behind composting is to purposely attempt to put the two together in such a way that decomposition happens effectively (and quickly) so we can put that garden gold to work.Here’s how the C:N numbers work: look at the first number (C). If that number is higher than 30, the material is considered to be a carbon product; if that first number is lower than 30, it’s considered a nitrogen product.But I promise you that the specific ratios don’t matter. You don’t need to memorize this stuff because most things either have more carbon and fall on the brown materials list or they’re heavier in nitrogen which puts them on green materials list—and they’re pretty easy to figure out at a glance. The best formula I’ve used is from the Master Gardeners: 1 part brown (carbon) to 1 part green (nitrogen)—just 50/50. There are a couple more ingredients you’ll need, but let’s meet the organic material first.Brown MaterialsThe microbial and macrobial critters in your compost like carbohydrates as much as the next living thing, plus they need it for energy. It comes to them in the form of brown or carbon organic mate -\n",
      "rials in your pile. Like I mentioned earlier, living things are made up of both carbon and nitrogen, but some are heavy on the carbon side and these are referred to as the “browns.”As an example, straw has a carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of about 80:1; which is 80 parts carbon (brown) to 1 part nitrogen (green). Sawdust is 500:1, and leaves are 60:1. All of these things are in the brown category.Here are some examples of carbon materials you might find around your home:\n",

Aerobes are the most effective among the decomposing bacteria. So an aerobic pile is also referred to as an “active” pile. Anaerobic bacteria lives (is active) in the absence of oxygen. Aerobic bacterial organisms are those that occur when oxygen is absent in a compost pile.\n",
      "Usually, the gardener’s goal is to get their hands on some rich compost as fast as they can. One of the best ways to get on the fast track to decomposition is to have nearly equal amounts of water and air in your pile. The microbes don’t function well in a dry pile, so you’re looking for about 40 percent moisture, which is about as wet as a wrung-out sponge. If the pile reaches more than 60 percent moisture, it can become anaerobic; in other words, it’s being starved of oxygen. The take-away here is you want equal amounts of greens and browns, keep it damp (like a wrung-out sponge), and keep it aerated.\n",

Due to its biochemical structure, humus acts as a buffer for soils that fall slightly to one side of acidic or alkaline.

      "How Important Is a Compost Bin?\n",
      "Truthfully? Not very important at all. In gardening circles the term “bin” is used loosely. For instance, three pallets that are standing on end and connected together surrounding a compost pile is referred to as a bin. A compost bin can also be made from a large piece of galvanized wire or hardware cloth formed into a circle, wire fencing around steel fence posts, stacked cinderblocks, or picket fencing. All are just barriers that keep the pile rather pulled together, but aren’t a bin in the sense of a completely enclosed container with a lid. The idea is to confine the materials so that there’s a combination of green materials, brown materials, moisture, and air. And for that, you don’t need a bin at all; the compost pile could even be on the open ground.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "The soil around the bottom of a compost pile is rich and ready for planting. You can take advantage of that by planting a vining crop such as mini pumpkins, climbing cucumbers, or nasturtium flowers around the base of the compost pile. These plants will soon cover the entire bin with attractive vines, flowers, and fruit.\n",
      "Stylish market compost bins aren’t essential, but they aren’t without their merits. For one, you may be worried that dogs, raccoons, and other critters will be encouraged to loiter around, given all the free food. This is a legitimate concern and it’s the best way to be sure that things placed into the compost stay put. Containers with secure lids are a great idea, especially if you’re adding kitchen scraps to your pile, which is really what the critters are after.Another reason is aesthetics. Some people just prefer the “look” of a compost bin to the look of an open pile, which may seem messy. They may feel that it looks better to their neighbors, as well. An enclosed bin retains moisture longer, so that can be a plus.Part 2: The Basics: Soil and Seed112\n",

This is because naturally occurring micro- and macroorganisms will be quickly drawn to your pile, which is exactly what it needs to get things cooking.There are several ways to keep air in a pile, but for simplicity’s sake, the easiest way is to turn it. You could use a pitchfork and turn the pile over in the spot that it’s in or move the pile from one place to an area right next to it. It should be turned once or twice a week—or never (more on that in the next section), depending on how fast you’d like it to break down.Your pile should stay about as damp as a wrung-out sponge.

      "Composting Styles: Hot, Warm, or Cold\n",
      "No matter how much time you have (or the length of your attention span), there’s a composting style for everybody. A “hot” or “fast” compost pile is exactly what it sounds like: core temperatures can range from 113°F to 160°F. A “warm” or “hybrid” compost pile doesn’t get as hot, nor break down as quickly, but it’s respectable and requires very little attention. Then again, if you just want to toss it and forget about it, a “cold” or “passive” compost pile might be for you—although this method takes the longest amount of time for the organic matter to decompose. (I have to admit that I gave those compost piles that are “halfway” tended the moniker “hybrid” or “warm,” because I had no idea how else to describe them. This is the composting technique that I use most of the time.)How you balance the brown and green materials will determine whether you have a hot, warm, or cold compost pile.Hot (fast) composting tips:\n",

It can become anaerobic, which is again about adding some browns and aerating the pile.\n",

From then on, I planted my broccoli and cilantro in the fall, and found that they produced a better harvest for longer. I suggest you try planting at each end of the season, as well, to see which works best for you.Some cool-season crops can go well beyond cool and into the freezing cold—all the way through snowy winters.

The truth is that you don’t have to rely on anyone but yourself and your mother plants in order to grow gardens forever, if you use propagation techniques. Propagating is simply making more plants from mature plant tissues (sometimes called the mother plant). There are many ways to go about propagating plants, including seeds, cuttings, division, leaves, roots, layering, bulbs, grafting, etc. However, for the purposes of this book, we’re going to discuss the most basic practices: seeds and softwood cuttings. Vegetables, herbs, and cane berries are typically propagated in these ways.For me, propagation has always been one of the best parts about growing things.

Almost all of the strawberry plants you purchase will grow runners, whether they’re June-bearing, everbearing, or day-neutral varieties.The roots at the end of the runner eventually touch the soil and begin to grow into the ground, which, in effect, creates a young strawberry plant (plantlet) exactly like its mother. You can take advantage of this situation by placing a small container filled with loamy, nutrient-rich soil under-neath the runner’s roots. Bendable stolons make directing them a simple task.Once the runner is sitting on the soil in your container, place a staple-shaped wire over the middle of the runner to hold it in place to give the plantlet roots a chance to take hold. After several weeks or when you notice that the plantlet is well-rooted, simply snip the runner away from the mother plant. You now have a brand-new plant to start another strawberry bed, plant in a container, or give to a friend.If you hadn’t cut the runner from the mother plant and it was left to its own devices, the runner would eventually shrivel up and die as the little plantlet takes hold.

No nursery or garden center can compete with the vast selection of varieties, colors, flavors, and characteristics offered in seed catalogs. Armed with several of these—in print or online—the world is your oyster.Growing from seed is also the cheapest way to get plants without sacrificing quality, and the inexpensive/good quality combo always gets my attention.

If you start some of your seeds directly into the garden bed, you’ll avoid transplant shock entirely. Starting from seed not only gives you a jump on the season, it allows you as an organic gardener the assurance that your plants (and vegetables) have been raised chemical-free.Some people don’t like to start from seed because they’ve never done so before and it can seem difficult. For the most part, it really isn’t. I’ll admit that occasionally seeds won’t germinate, a soil fungus will wipe them out, or the cat will dig into their little growing pots and mush them. It happens. But usually, most of them germinate and a couple die—and that doesn’t matter because you suddenly realize you have no idea where you’re going to put all of these seedlings once they’ve grown up.

Within about 7 to 10 days, the seeds will begin to germinate—or not. If over half of them have sprouted, this is decent viability.

The reason you start some vegetables indoors and under lights before they can safely be planted outside is twofold.The first reason is that some vegetables (or a vegetable variety) need a high number of days to mature before they’ll produce harvestable fruit, which is very often the case with tomato varieties. If you waited until the soil was warm enough to plant them directly into the garden bed, you may not have enough warm days to reach the maturity date of that plant before the temperatures dropped and killed the tomatoes.Part 2: The Basics: Soil and Seed128\n",

      "Hybrid Seeds\n",
      "Hybrid vegetable plants (and seeds) are the offspring of two plants that are of different varieties, as produced through human manipulation for specific genetic characteristics. These varieties have a closely related gene pool (basically recycled), which leaves very little genetic diversity in the plant.What this means to you is that if you save the seeds from a hybrid vegetable, the resulting plant will not resemble its parents. Conversely, it will end up with throwback genes and could look (and taste) like any number of things hiding inside its genetic code. In other words, hybrids don’t breed true, and some hybrid seeds are sterile, so they won’t geminate at all. Hybrids are created and often owned (patented) by the company that created the cross, as well.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "An F1 hybrid (first filial) is the first generation of plants created by crossing two different plant variet-ies or types. To produce consistent results, the same cross has to be made each year.\n",
      "From a commercial point of view, hybrids make sense as they do what they were bred to do, which is to provide the following: fruit with uniform color and shape, high yields, fast production, longer shelf life, and the ability to withstand long truck hauls.

      "ism (GMO) foods. They’re not the same thing, although they’re often used interchangeably—and incorrectly. GM foods are crop plants that have been genetically engineered or modified to have specific desirable traits. In laboratories, plant geneticists isolate a single gene from one plant and insert it into a different plant to create one that’s drought-resistant or herbicide-resistant. Genes from nonplants such as bacteria and fish are often inserted into crops, as well.Part 2: The Basics: Soil and Seed130\n",
      "h\n",
      "Open-Pollinated Seeds\n",
      "Open-pollinated plants (and seeds) are those that have been pollinated naturally by bees or other insects, mammals, or the wind. Seeds created in this way will “breed true” to their parent plant. In other words, if you plant the seeds from open-pollinated plants, they will grow up to look, act, and taste like the plant they came from.If you’re interested in saving seeds from your vegetables to replant next year, open-pollinated plants are the right ones for the job. Neither open-pollinated nor heirloom vegetables are owned by anyone—they belong to everybody, so feel free to save and grow to your heart’s desire.\n",

      "’re going to save seeds from your vegetables, you should know that varieties as well as family \n",
      "members are capable of cross-pollination with one another; some more readily than others. In order to be certain that you’re getting pure seed from a specific variety, techniques such as bagging, caging, or distance may be used. Some gardeners simply save their seeds and don’t worry about keeping a specific variety pure.\n",
      "Heirloom Seeds\n",
      "First of all, heirloom (or heritage) plants are always open-pollinated as they’re a subset of the open-pollinated category. What makes a vegetable (or flower or fruit) an “heirloom” plant? This depends on whom you ask.Some gardeners feel that the variety has to have a generational history—and a story—to be called an heirloom. Purists don’t label an open-pollinated plant an heirloom unless it can be traced back 100 years. Although there’s no official standard for heirlooms, today most gardeners agree that  an heirloom variety is an open-pollinated variety that’s been handed down through families for  50 years or more.Heirloom plants were brought to America by immigrants worldwide. They’re rich with culture, and many have wonderful stories attached to them. As favorite family vegetables whose seeds had been saved and passed down from generation to generation, they’re worth a second (and third) look.You may be wondering So what’s the big deal about heirlooms? or Why should I plant them in my vertical vegetable garden? Give me one good reason. I’ll give you five great ones.Chapter 7: A Plant Primer131\n",
      "h\n",
      "Fantastic Flavor\n",
      "Any vine-ripe vegetable grown in the home garden (hybrids included) beats store-bought vegetables any day of the week. Still, most heirlooms have a flavor factor that the prolific hybrids simply can’t match. Many of these food plants were selected and handed down through generations expressly for taste. Commercial hybrids are created for uniformity in color, shape, size, yield, transporting abilities, and the ease of machine-harvesting. This isn’t to say that there are not delicious hybrids—there certainly are. But heirlooms come in many varieties (and therefore, flavors) to please the palate.\n",
      "Adaptability\n",
      "Heirloom plants have an inherent ability to adapt naturally to their environment. This includes acclimating to the soil they’re planted in as well as the specific climate. Historically, as vegetable varieties adjusted to their environments, they also developed resistances to local pests and diseases. In other words, there were strong, viable plants suited to every area. Because these plants evolved naturally, nothing was mechanically altered (and therefore given up), and their fruit was able to retain their delicious flavors.\n",
      "Control\n",
      "Food is a basic human necessity, and the person who controls the seed controls the food supply. Unfortunately, a handful of companies control all of our commercial seeds worldwide. This is possible because they literally own the seed. Heirlooms are owned by no one—and everyone. They give you control over how your food is grown, what’s put on it, and which vegetable types you’ll grow.\n",
      "Links to Our Heritage\n",
      "Heirlooms weren’t always called “heirlooms.” In fact, the term heirloom  wasn’t even used until the \n",
      "1980s! They were simply traditional vegetables grown in gardens everywhere. They were the staples of life. Some of the heirlooms that have been preserved by family seed-saving go as far back as 2,000 years or more. Connected to those seeds is the history of our ancestors and who they were, which gives us a basic definition of who we are. In a nutshell, seeds are a living heritage for people. We can hand down antique furniture, jewelry, and paintings, but none of these are living things.Part 2: The Basics: Soil and Seed132\n",
      "h\n",
      "Along with great stories come the variety names. Monikers such as Beaver Dam, Moon & Stars, and Lady Godiva pumpkins, Rattlesnake and Dragon Tongue beans, Tall Telephone peas, and Mascara, Drunken Woman, and Frizzy-Headed lettuce always bring a smile … and excellent questions. By the way, these characteristics can also belong to other open-pollinated vegetables that aren’t necessarily considered heirlooms. They just may not have the extensive history of their counterparts.\n",
      "Genetic Diversity\n",
      "This trait is what allows so many varieties of vegetables to exist in so many different areas. Gardeners in Alaska can have potatoes just like gardeners in California—all because there are varieties adapted for each environment. Diverse genes are also what protect us from having one pest or disease attack a crop like beans and wipe every one of them out. This is a true drawback for those planting a monoculture.Perhaps one of the best examples of a monoculture gone wrong is the Irish potato famine of 1845. During the 1840s potatoes were Ireland’s main food staple. Every farmer grew a variety called Lumper, which was vegetatively cloned; each plant was genetically identical. During the fall of 1845, North America inadvertently introduced a deadly fungus that attacked the potatoes, destroy -\n",
      "ing every single potato crop. Thousands of people fled Ireland in an attempt to survive, and more than a million people died of starvation due to the lack of genetic diversity among their plantings.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "One of the simplest things you can do for your garden is to make it impossible for any insect or disease to devastate a plant species. The best way to achieve this goal is to practice broad genetic diversity by planting different vegetable varieties.\n",
      "Hardening Off Seedlings\n",
      "“Hardening off” bridges the gap between coddling your baby seedlings indoors (where they were completely protected from the weather, good or bad) and immediately starting life outdoors in their permanent garden bed or container. It makes no difference that the seeds you started are sun-loving tomatoes. If you toss them outside willy-nilly you’ll have burned leaves, which could mean dead plants, considering that seedlings don’t have very many leaves at this point.Chapter 7: A Plant Primer133\n",
      "h\n",
      "It’s not just the bright sun that we’re worried about, either. Temperatures inside your home (and under lights) compared to the outdoors (especially at night) can be enough to kill young plants if they aren’t acclimated first.Bringing your little ones outdoors under a protected (covered) area for a couple of hours starts the  7-to-14-day hardening off process. Notice that I said under cover,  as opposed to in the sunshine.  \n",
      "I prefer to get the seedlings outside to feel the breezes and the difference of the degrees before I pop them out into the sun.I bring them back indoors after 2 to 3 hours. After a couple of days vacationing in a shaded area, I place them out in the light for 1 hour—and it’ll usually be morning sun because it’s gentler on them than the brilliant afternoon sun. I always bring them back into the house at night, although after their daily dose of sun, I may pull them back under cover and not bring them into the house until evening. Day after day, I increase the time that they spend in the sun. After about a week, I let them spend the night outdoors in a covered or protected area.The stretches in the sun become longer until about 2 weeks after I began the process, I simply plant them into their new home. So, what’s with the 7-to-14-day process? Well, sometimes when I’m hardening off seedlings that will live the rest of their lives receiving only morning sun, I never actually make it to the 2 weeks because the plants simply don’t require it. As you experiment, you may find that you don’t need the full 2 weeks with certain plants, either.\n",
      "Cuttings\n",
      "Vegetative propagation includes techniques that involve separating some vegetative part (roots, shoots, and leaves) of a plant in order to create new ones, as opposed to collecting seeds, which is sexual propagation (reproduction).Cuttings are a favorite propagation technique because some plants can be difficult to start from seed.

      "Water is at the top of the list when it comes to what’s important to a garden. In order to save water, time, and money and have healthy plants with higher yields, you need to get the water to the roots directly and steadily. Unlike traditional horizontal plots, your vertical garden is smaller and planted more intensely, and this leaves you with a wide variety of choices.How much and how often should you water? I wish I could offer you a definitive answer, but there are several things to take into consideration. Would you describe your soil as loam, sand, or clay? Do you live in a windy area? Are these new transplants, seeds, or established plants? Raised beds or containers? Because every garden is different, there are some general rules-of-thumb that you can tweak according to your specific growing needs.Seeds .

Continue watering the seedlings every day (like seeds), and after 2 to 3 weeks graduate to three times a week.

Remember that anything you transplant should be done so in the cool morning hours and watered before and after it’s planted.hPart 3: Tending the Vertical Vegetable Garden140\n",

      "Established herbs, shrubs, or trees. If the plants in question have been recently planted, they’ll need regular watering until they become established. For herbaceous perennials this might mean 6 months, and for trees or shrubs a year or more. Again, how many times they’re actually watered depends on your soil (clay, loam, or sand) and the particular plants. I keep everything evenly watered if it’s new to my garden, and as woody plants and trees become established, I water them one to two times a week during the hot months.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "When discussing woody plants and trees, deep watering less often is almost always preferred over shallow watering more often. Deep watering encourages deeper roots.\n",

This list includes beans, beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, celery, cucumbers, eggplant, kale, leeks, lettuce, mustard greens, onions, peas, peppers, potatoes, radishes, spinach, and summer squash. Since the top several inches of soil dry out the fastest, these plants will need more watering, for less time.Deep-rooted vegetables whose roots are capable of penetrating past 24\" include asparagus, parsnips, pumpkin, rhubarb, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, watermelon, and winter squash. These plants need to be watered less frequently, but deeply.As far as my vertical vegetable and herb gardens go, I tend to keep the vegetable’s soil damp and the herb’s soil on the drier side. It’s a simple, no-frills strategy that works for me. If this is your first garden and you worry that the soil looks wet on top, but aren’t sure that you watered for long enough, try this:\n",

      "where the damp soil ends. If the root zone of those plants isn’t damp, then water again. Damp soil should be dark and moist like coffee grounds or chocolate cake. If the soil is soggy, water less next time.\n",
      "Sprinklers\n",
      "Sprinkler systems are almost always the least efficient way to water any garden. First of all, sprin -\n",
      "kler heads are fairly inaccurate. I realize that they can be positioned to spray water into a general direction, but in reality, they end up watering places that simply don’t need water, such as concrete patios. They also tend to wet plant foliage, which can encourage fungus to take up residence on the plants. Second, they allow for a ton of evaporation, which isn’t efficient or cost-effective.Chapter 8: Feed, Water, and Nurture141\n",
      "h\n",
      "On the other hand, if all you have on hand is a sprinkler, it’ll still get the job done. To make it the best that it can be you’ll want to have the right sprinkler head for the garden; for instance, don’t have a full circle head placed between the garden bed and the driveway. Also, adjust the heads so they don’t aim the water at leaves (or walls), and use a timer to prevent over-watering and simplify the task for you at the same time. One final trick with using sprinklers is to turn the water pressure on low. Doing so prevents water runoff by allowing the water to sink slowly into the soil.\n",
      "Hand Watering\n",
      "Hand watering may be a time-consuming task, but there’s something about it, right? It’s so relax -\n",
      "ing and mindless that it’s almost zen-like. Maybe it’s just me. Anyway, if you have a very small garden or are gardening on your patio or deck, hand watering may be the only thing you need for irrigation.There are all types of gadgets for hand watering, such as long watering wands and simple to fancy-schmancy water nozzles with 15 different settings to help you get the job done. Don’t even get me started on the vast array of watering cans on the market; from colorful plastic to hand-painted, galvanized metal, they can become somewhat of an addiction (or so I’ve heard).Watering by hand puts you in a good position to control the water flow, too, which is awesome because this is another way that gives the soil a chance to absorb water and avoid wasteful runoff. Just think slow.  I recently heard this technique described as watering as you would pour tea: care -\n",
      "fully and slowly. The idea is to linger as you water the bed or container so that it’s absorbed into the soil before adding more.If you’re hitting plant leaves with water instead of just the root zone, you could encourage leaf diseases just like the sprinklers can. Your best bet is to be sure to water early in the morning so that any leaves you do hit have a chance to dry off during the day. Also, just like the sprinkler, if you’re watering soil areas where there aren’t any plant roots, then you’re probably watering weed seeds. So do your best to keep the water under the plants.\n",
      "Soaker Hoses\n",
      "Soaker hoses look like garden hoses with pores. When attached to a hose or spigot they slowly “sweat” moisture into the soil. The water seeps slowly along the entire length of the hose directly at the root zone. You can place them down along a row of vegetables, weave them throughout a garden bed, or make a circle at the drip line of a fruit tree. They’re not a good choice for containers but are great almost anywhere else.Part 3: Tending the Vertical Vegetable Garden142\n",
      "h\n",
      "Drip Irrigation\n",
      "Drip irrigation is truly the best bet for most gardens. Drip systems do a bang-up job delivering the water to all the right places. They’re great for vegetables gardens, fruit trees, and berry cane beds. In containers is where they truly shine. We have some hot summers here in California, and it isn’t unusual to water containers twice a day in the summer (depending). Drip irrigation makes my life much easier when it comes to my containers.Here’s how it works: it’s a tube system that has evenly spaced drip emitters coming off of the tubes. Usually, each plant has its own personal emitter, although when plants are closely spaced, they may share one. Some systems come with the emitters factory installed into the tubing, and some are made so that you attach them yourself.Another benefit to using a drip system is that the entire garden surface area isn’t soaked, so you’ve got fewer weeds popping up. Drip systems are often sold in kits, but can be purchased piecemeal, too. Admittedly, these systems take a bit more planning, but they aren’t difficult to assemble. The drawback to using drip emitters is that they may periodically become clogged, so it’s important to check each emitter from time to time and watch your plants for signs that they’re lacking water.\n",
      "Rain Barrels\n",
      "I think rain barrels are one of the best ideas ever. Not that it’s a modern thing by any means; people have been collecting rainwater for centuries, but it’s once again coming into vogue. Water falls from the sky seasonally every year, and collecting and storing some for the sunny days ahead is brilliant. Think about this: off of a 1,000-square-foot roof, 600 gallons of water can be collected from only 1\" of rainfall. That’s a lot of free water.A rain barrel is a large container (barrel or not) that’s connected to the end of the downspout that runs along the roof on the outside of your home. As the rain washes off the roof, instead of going through the downspout and becoming stormwater runoff, it’s collected in a barrel. Barrels have a screen over any open areas to prevent mosquitoes from reproducing and to keep debris out of the container, too. Most barrels have a spigot at the bottom so you can fill a watering can or bucket.There’s some controversy on collecting rainwater this way. Some people claim it is “natural soft water” that doesn’t contain chlorine, fluoride, minerals, or any other chemicals. Others claim there are impurities in the water due to the fact that the roof itself could leach chemicals or that air quality may be poor (pollution), therefore tainting the rainwater. One more interesting thing about collecting rainwater—it may be illegal. That’s right, apparently some states believe the water falling over your home doesn’t belong to you, and therefore you cannot harvest it. So, double-check that before you install one.Chapter 8: Feed, Water, and Nurture143\n",

It’s a cheap, easy, and earth-friendly technique that works!Cardboard works as well as newspaper, but it’ll take a little longer to break down. Also, a thick layer of compost has the same mulch-type benefits of any other organic mulch.\n",
      "Inorganic Mulch\n",
      "Inorganic materials such as landscape cloth or black plastic can be an extra-effective mulch for hot soil lovers such as pumpkins, watermelons, and cucumbers. Black plastic is especially nice because not only does it smother weeds and retain moisture, but it also ramps up the heat in the soil.If you choose to use solid plastic, you’ll want to add holes (or slits) so that water can flow freely underneath. Some landscape fabrics don’t allow water to penetrate fast enough, so be sure to check that and add holes if necessary. Both materials are easily removed at season’s end.Mediterranean herbs appreciate mason’s sand as a mulch, which not only helps drainage, but reflects precious sunshine that many herbs crave.

      "About Crop Rotation\n",
      "Crop rotation is a fundamental organic gardening practice. It’s not a hard concept, but it does take a little bit of planning—mostly in the way of pencil and paper to keep track of plants. The good news is that many of us are keeping track of the plants and where we plant them anyway, so it may be no extra effort for you to give it a try.It’s all about changing the beds that crops are grown in from season to season; usually on a 4-year cycle. Rotating crops season after season is a great idea for a couple of reasons. First, this technique preserves biological diversity, which can prevent the buildup of diseases in the soil, as well as pests that attack specific crops. Second, crop rotation can prevent the heavy feeders from depleting the soil of nutrients; in some cases, actually improving soil fertility.I’ll be the first to admit that crop rotation can be challenging in the smaller beds (or containers) that are often used when gardening vertically. If this is the case for you, don’t worry; it’s not a deal-breaker by any means. You may not have enough beds or what-have-you for this practice, but it’s a good technique to know and you can use it in any way you see fit.There are a couple of ways to go about crop rotation. The first is about sorting by individual veg -\n",
      "etable families, the family rotation plan; and the second is based on the nutritional needs of these plants, the soil fertility rotation plan.\n",
      "Family Rotation Plan\n",
      "Each vegetable plant falls into an extended family (see the following sidebar). These families share specific enemies (pests and disease) that enjoy feasting on them. For instance, fungal diseases such as blight attack potatoes and tomatoes, which are both in the nightshade family. Flea beetles like these crops, too. Brassicas such as broccoli and kale belong to the cabbage family, and are pestered by cabbage looper moths and cutworms. You get the idea.Let’s say that you have four beds and the first one is planted with lettuce, kale, and broccoli. While these vegetables are growing, they’re potentially calling in pests and diseases that are specific to those crops. Both the pests and the diseases can be harbored in the soil just waiting for the same type of plants to come along again. So the next time you plant these vegetables, you’ll plant them in the second bed, effectively tricking all the undesirables.Do the same thing with the remaining beds—just move each plant group to the next bed. Inciden -\n",
      "tally, if you only have three beds rotate those three or rotate some of the vegetables out and into containers. It doesn’t have to be perfect or done according to some printed plan.

      "There’s another way to rotate crops, and that’s according to whether they are leaf, root, flower, or fruit crops. This system is not necessarily better or worse than rotating families, but it’s a good plan for small gardens (the situation for many vertical gardens).

This style is based on rotating crops that have different nutritional demands.As you learned earlier in the chapter, the three major players in soil nutrition are nitrogen, phos -\n",

If you have an extremely shady yard or you’d like to have more sun reaching the area under a tree for plants or lawn, careful pruning can let in a little extra sunshine.Provide health and structural soundness. Any diseased, injured, dying, or dead branches should be removed for the health of the tree. Branches that rub together should be removed to eliminate potential damage to a main branch.

Plants that have grown out of balance with either the yard or their own growing pattern (such as stray and awkward branches) can be reshaped by pruning.Most pruning is about working with a plant’s natural growth pattern as it’s developing, as well as maintaining mature fruit trees along with other tree and shrub species. One of the few exceptions is when you’re pruning for special effects such as espalier (a pruning technique that trains fruit trees to grow flat along a fence or wall). That said, you’ll be doing a certain amount of pruning in the vertical vegetable garden.\n",
      "Pra CtiCal Pr Unin G: toMato  Plants\n",
      "Should you prune your tomato plants or leave them to their own devices? There are some great reasons to prune them and one good reason to leave them alone. The answer has to do with the type of tomatoes that you have planted and your personal preference. Vining tomato plants that produce fruit all season long are called “indeterminate” tomatoes, and therein lies a terrific example of pruning in the vegetable garden. Determinate (bush type) tomato plants are rarely pruned because they reach a certain height and set fruit all at once.Indeterminate tomatoes can grow to be 10' tall and become a veritable jungle. Some of the branches are actually “suckers” that just drain the plant’s energy. Yes, they’ll eventually flower and produce fruit, but maybe not before they outgrow the garden space that you’ve allotted them.There are a couple of issues with all those branches and one of them is energy. Tomato plants have to use a lot of energy to produce those leaves and branches alongside the fruit. Pruning will allevi-ate some of that burden, and the energy will go to producing fruit.Chapter 8: Feed, Water, and Nurture155\n",
      "h\n",
      "An extra perk is that tomato plants stay slender and under control so they can be grown in a smaller area than a plant that’s allowed to run rampant.If there’s a downside, it’s that there will be less fruit produced because pruning involves removing would-be branches. This doesn’t bother me with an indeterminate plant because they continue to give me fruit up until a hard frost.If you’re growing determinate plants, pruning may not be the right answer. Determinate tomatoes grow to a specific height and then produce their tomato harvest all at once. Most people don’t want to limit the tomatoes grown on a determinate bush because you get one shot at fruit and then the show is over.\n",

      "When we think of pruning, it’s the woody and vining plants that come to mind. We may picture piles of branches worthy of a gas-powered chipper-shredder. Pruning may not ever get quite that serious in your vertical vegetable garden; however, kiwifruits and grapes need pruning in order to train the vines.Espaliered fruit trees will need to be trained along a trellis or a wall, as well. Grafted plants (like grapes) will need the shoots (called suckers) growing from below the graft union (swollen part of the plant) pruned off. You can gain control of the size and fruit production of those indeterminate tomato plants by pruning off the suckers there, too.Part 3: Tending the Vertical Vegetable Garden156\n",

      "Even if your garden doesn’t require the previously mentioned pruning techniques, there will be other versions of pruning going on: pinching and deadheading. Both of these practices are pruning techniques in their own right: you’re removing part of the plant. But pinching and deadheading aren’t the same thing. It’s all about the timing. When you remove flower buds and developing seed heads from cilantro, you’re pinching. Pinching is done before the plants bloom to control the shape, size, or flower production. In the case of this herb, you want to stop the flowers from showing up because it sends a signal to the plant to stop growing—that its life is over. We try to put off this signal as long as we can because we want to harvest cilantro’s leaves.When you remove the spent flowers or seed pods from a plant, you’re deadheading. It directs plant energy to new plant growth as opposed to the dying stuff. This is why deadheading flowering plants routinely gives you the maximum amount of blossoms.h9What’s Bugging \n",

He’s the cavalry!”The woman said that she found many of them among her roses and I asked her if she had also found a lot of aphids on her roses as well. She assured me that aphids were covering the plants—bingo! The soldier beetles had heard her roses’ cry for help and showed up just in the nick of time.The obvious moral of the story is to learn to recognize the difference between friend and foe.

My solution is to sacrifice two tomato plants and toss the rest of the hornworms to my chickens (gruesome, I know).

They’re non- or low-toxic to pets and people, too.Some prepared formulas that you’ll find on the market are also supposed to be safe for beneficial insects. That’s a harder claim to prove, plus the other school of thought is that anything that kills something can’t be considered entirely nontoxic.

All you do is spread it around the ground wherever you’ve seen these unwanted pests. As they move across the powder, it sticks to their feet and legs and works its way into their joints and exoskeleton.This is bad news for these insects because DE is made up of crushed fossilized skeletons of diatoms and algae.

Thankfully, this snack proves to be their last, as 3 to 6 days after ingesting the Sluggo, these critters crawl off and die.During this time you may see them still creeping along the soil, but they can’t actually eat, which is the beauty of iron phosphate.

      "Premixed insecticidal soaps (considered nontoxic) can be found at nurseries, garden centers, and online. Spray soaps aren’t a preventative measure; they control pests after they’ve already arrived on your plants. Soaps coat the critter, which causes the insect’s cells to collapse. In other words, they kill the bugs that are bugging you. Also once the soap has dried, it’s no longer effective.Sometimes you just can’t beat a lesson from a little old-fashioned soap. Soft-bodied little suckers (literally) such as whiteflies, aphids, mites, and leaf miners are easily done in by a simple soap spray. You can try this in your own garden by mixing 3 to 5 tablespoons of liquid dish soap and a little vegetable oil to a gallon of water. Pour the mixture into a hand-held spray bottle or garden sprayer and use it on infested plants during the morning hours when the sun is low and temperatures are cool.

This is another control that isn’t a “knock-down” solution; it works slowly, but surely. It’s a very specific bacterium that targets certain caterpillars.

Before you apply oil (petroleum) products, be sure to choose the right horticultural oil to the right pest.One last thing: do your plant research before using oils for pest control.

It’s a good technique for organic gardeners and those who are living a sustainable lifestyle. IPM relies on the gardener or farmer to gather information and monitor the garden. IPM doesn’t prohibit pesticides, but seeks to solve pest problems before reaching the pesticide level of control. IPM users often encourage “spot treating” (applying the pesticide to only the plant that’s affected instead of wide-spraying) when it comes to pesticide use in the garden.Following is an overview of how IPM works.Determine whether you really have a pest problem.

We’re programmed to be intolerant of any pest that crosses our path. But if you have only slightly blemished fruit, the natural balance is probably pretty stable. In fact, if that’s all the worries you have, this is what we call successful gardening.Access your tolerance level. Everyone has his or her own tolerance level. For instance, you may decide that the damage isn’t a very big deal, yet someone else may feel that the particular plant isn’t worth the hassle.

Soybeans will mature anywhere between 60 to 95 days.

      "Many gardening conversations revolve around slicing cucumbers and why some gardeners enjoy fabulous flavor while others end up with bitter fruit. Some gardeners blame it on hand-pollination (a technique where the gardener takes some pollen from a male flower and brushes it onto the female flower by hand). Let’s set the record straight. Bitter cucumbers are all about cultural influences, not pollination—although some cukes that are grown specifically for pickling may be bitter if eaten raw. If plants are allowed to dry out instead of being kept evenly moist while the fruit is in production, or if soils fluctuate between very dry and wet, you run the risk of bitter fruit.\n",

      "Cucumbers mature quickly, so check the vines daily for ripe fruit because if it’s left on the vine and completely matures, the whole plant is signaled to halt production.

The melon category includes muskmelons, watermelons, honeydews, charentias, crenshaws, and more.Believe it or not, some of the melons listed here won’t need any added support if the fruit weighs in at 2 lb. or less. If a variety produces fruit that’s larger, I would use a cloth or netted sling to support them until they mature. In any case, plan to train your melons up a sturdy trellis that has a strong climbing support, such as a ladder A-frame (more in Chapter 4). If the melons mature to more than a couple of pounds, tuck a sling under each fruit and secure the sling to the climbing support. Melon varieties that are between 2 lb. and 5 or 6 lb. are good candidates for growing vertically.\n",

Then they cut holes into the plastic and plant their young melons in the holes. This technique heats the soil up nicely and helps the melons mature quickly. I recommend adding some random slices or holes into the plastic so that water reaches the roots easily and there’s some ventilation.While the plants and immature fruit are growing, avoid intermittent watering schedules. Melons enjoy regular, even watering (not waterlogging, however) and the fruit may suffer otherwise. That fabulous melon flavor shows up in the fruit during the last 2 weeks on the vine. So at that point, ease up on the watering without letting them dry out entirely. The idea here is that they will develop less flavor if they’re heavily watered close to harvest time.\n",

Some gardeners also add a handful of pelletized lime, which helps to ward off blossom end rot as well as to sweeten the soil if it’s a little too acidic.A handful of bone meal is another gardener favorite for the tomato planting hole because it also combats blossom end rot as it offers calcium to the plant.

The fact is that they tend to grow like a beanstalk as long as they’re offered support.Indeterminate vines can reach up to 12' tall and will potentially take up a lot of space unless they’re pruned. Staking or caging is a must, and they’ll need continued support with ties or by trellising throughout production. That said, with good pruning, they’re very controllable in a small-space garden setting.Determinates might be more compact, but indeterminate varieties have a lot going for them in their own right. These productive vines produce a higher fruit yield per square foot compared to their bushy cousins, and they win the taste test every time. In general, their tomatoes are bigger and tastier, and they continue to produce right up until a hard frost kills them.

The truth is that the “baby” cucumber wasn’t a cucumber at all.

Male flowers make their appearance first and the female flowers follow. When you see a flower with a little fruit at the base, you’re looking at a female. She needs to be pollinated or that little fruit will never develop into something edible.Something (or someone) has to get the pollen from the male flower to the female flower. Unfortu-nately, there aren’t always enough bees or other insects around to pollinate your plants. If you want to be certain that your plants are pollinated, you’ve got to step up to the plate!Hand-pollinating summer and winter squash is a simple technique that comes in handy when the bees and other pollinating insects haven’t done the job themselves.

You now have instant fertilization. You can also use an artist’s paint brush and gently rub the bristles all around the male flower’s anthers.

But if you want to give them the room to grow properly, you’ll show them the tough love.Seedlings that are closer than 2\" together are gently pulled out or snipped off with a pair of small scissors at the soil line. Using scissors is better in my opinion because it ensures that other seedling roots aren’t disturbed. Toss the thinned ones into a salad or to your chickens.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "A good way to remind yourself to thin carrot seedlings at the right time is to plant radish seeds in between them. Radish seeds come up very fast, which reminds the gardener to water the bed; about the time that the radishes are being harvested, the carrots will need to be thinned. So there’s no competition and no wasted time or garden space.\n",
      "The seedlings won’t need as much water as the seeds did before germination, but they do enjoy cool roots and warm shoulders (tops of carrots and the greens). When the weather really heats up, a layer of organic mulch can be tossed over them.\n",

      "Carrots can be harvested while they’re quite young (and the most tender) or when they’re fully mature, which is when they’re at their sweetest. Check the days to harvest for individual varieties, but most carrots are mature 2 to 3 months after their seeds have been sown.If your soil is loose and friable, they’ll slide right out with a gentile tug at the base of their green tops. But if the soil is dry or hard, use a garden fork to loosen the soil; you don’t want the tops to break off as you’re harvesting. Just slide the fork deep under the carrot roots and life gently.

Traditionally, espalier describes a central tree (or plant) stem that’s pruned so it has horizontal branch “arms” that are trained (tied) along supportive wires. In other words, the term was (and is) used to describe a specific shape.Today, most people also use it to describe this pruning technique (which trains fruit, ornamental trees, or shrubs) no matter which shape is used.

Any top growth on the plants should be cut back to where they have only 2 or 3 buds. Plant them as deep as they were in the containers they came in.Gently pull at the roots and straighten them so that they’re spread out in the planting hole. Fill in all with organically rich soil. Grapes aren’t fussy about soils, but they respond well to a basically fertile one, so adding compost to the bed makes sense.\n",
      "Tending Grapes\n",
      "Grapes aren’t heavy feeders, but if they’re in containers, some liquid seaweed or other well-balanced fertilizer at least once during the season will be well received. Their leaves are prone to fungal diseases, so water grapes at the soil line, preferably with drip irrigation.Fruit is produced on new growth, so the vines should be pruned each year. Pruning techniques will depend upon the type of grape. Grapes don’t need a lot of water, but they do need even  watering. \n",
      "Don’t let them dry out all the way and then drench them; it stresses out the plants and the fruit will suffer.\n",
      "Harvesting Grapes\n",
      "Unlike some other fruits, grapes will not continue to ripen once they are picked from the vine, so don’t pick them until they are fully mature. You can test for maturity by checking the color of the grapes, the size (when grapes are mature they stop growing), or simply by tasting one.\n",

Some raspberries are stiff-caned and are said to not need any support, but do it anyway—they’ll behave better.

      "Berries don’t like to compete with weeds, so mulch them well. Water them regularly throughout the growing season. And a berry patch well-amended with organic matter won’t need supplemental fertilizing. If you feel that you need to add it, fertilize just before the new growth starts.Fruit is produced on canes in their second year, so the first year that they’re planted, they won’t produce fruit. Brambles that produce berries only once a year (summer/fall) should have only the canes that have produced fruit cut to the ground. Leave the canes that haven’t produced yet undisturbed.Canes have different names depending on if it’s in its first or second year of growth. First-year canes are called primocanes and those in their second year are called floricanes. Floricanes die after they’ve produced fruit.

      "Blackberries should be harvested when they’re very black and firm, yet fully ripe. (Once picked, blackberries will not ripen any further.) If they’re still deep red or purplish, they’re not ready. Once ripe, they’ll pull away from the plant easily with just a slight tug.\n",
      "Good to Know\n",
      "Sometimes it’s hard to tell whether you’re looking at blackberries or black raspberries. The quickest way to tell the difference between a blackberry and a black raspberry is to pick a ripe fruit. You’ll know the berry is ripe because it will come easily from the vine. If it’s a black raspberry, the center of the fruit will be “hollow” and you’ll see the core is left on the vine. When a blackberry is plucked from the bramble the core stays inside the center of the fruit and the stem that’s left behind is flat and clean.\n",
      "When ripe, raspberries will also slip easily from the plant. Depending on the variety, the berries may be yellow, red, or purple. Choose firm and plump berries and give a little tug. Raspberries have a hollow center as the core is left on the plant when they’re pulled off. If it takes effort to harvest the berry, it’s not ready yet.Chapter 12: Vertical Fruit221\n",

But when I plant them in vertical containers with loamy soil, I place them much closer together.Strawberries shouldn’t be planted flush with the soil line because it encourages crown rot.

      "Kiwis (also called kiwifruit and Chinese gooseberries) are enjoying a growing popularity here in America, and for good reason. What kiwis lack in the good looks department they more than make up for in their sweet, tropical-tasting flesh. Kiwifruit’s flavor is hard to describe, but to say it’s reminiscent of a combination of other fruits such as strawberries/pineapple/melon blend is an accurate one.Most kiwi plants are either male of female—meaning they’ll bloom with either male or female flowers (dioecious). So be sure to acquire both sexes for your garden. Also, one male plant can easily pollinate six to eight females, so don’t worry about keeping the numbers even. Fair warning: female plants may take 5 years to produce that first crop. But if you’re a kiwi fan, it’ll be worth the wait.Typically, it’s the egg-sized, fuzzy-fruited variety that you’ll find in the grocery stores.

It’s a sweet-looking plant that’s all about tiny, dark green, grayish-green, or variegated leaves and texture. Thyme thrives naturally, living in dry, poor soil and rocky places, so it has no problem missing a watering or two. This devil-may-care attitude makes it perfectly suited to containers. Being a member of the mint family, heavily scented thyme is most popular for seasoning soups, stews, and meats.\n",

      "Like any plant that’s considered “drought tolerant,” light to moderate watering should begin after the plant is established in its new home. Water new thyme plants evenly for a few weeks and then space out the time between waterings.Thyme isn’t big on specific fertilizers. If it makes you feel better, you can add some compost to be sure that the soil drains well. I wasn’t kidding when I said “undemanding.”During the summer, pink, lavender, or white flowers will show up on little stalks. Of course, as far as leaf production, you’ll want to pinch those off; however, I always leave some because they’re excellent as pollinator attractors.

It’s not that they’re inedible, but that they’re not the best types for seasoning foods. Wooly thyme is rather … well, fuzzy. Most people don’t use it for cooking.

      "The cause of MS is not known, nor is there any known cure. Therefore \n",
      "it is impossible to say whether yoga directly addresses MS’s pathogenetic factors or the process of the illness. Yet there are many examples and some valid studies demonstrating that yoga can be of salutary bene ﬁ t in each type \n",
      "of MS. It appears that the practice of yoga sets up an antagonistic process that is often more powerful than the degenerative effects of the disease. Being a progressive, self-applied technique for maximal independence, its goals are strikingly appropriate. \n",
      "Regardless of whether there is loss of energy, reduced range of motion, \n",
      "spasticity, weakness, dyscoordination, imbalance, or numbness or paraes-thesias in different parts of the body, yoga can serve to minimize invol-untary muscle contraction, maximize ﬂ exible range, and improve strength, \n",
      "coordination, and balance. Y oga effectively diminishes the impact of sensory changes by raising functional abilities to a higher level, improving overall concentration, calm, and a realistic sense of well-being. Regardless of other factors, yoga energizes.\n",
      "Y oga is valuable to people with MS for three reasons. First, the practice of \n",
      "yoga reduces functional de ﬁ cits. Second, it increases self-reliance since it fosters \n",
      "independence and can be carried out independently. And third, it is one of the principal aims, in fact the principal aim of yoga, to steady and quiet the mind.\n",
      "113114Contemporary psychologists Paul Ekman, Joseph Campos, Richard David-\n",
      "son, and Frans de Waal (9) agree with William James that most forms of emo-tion are so closely associated with our bodily responses, we hardly know we have them when the body is passive. This applies in dramatically heightened force to people living with MS.\n",
      "Multicultural studies con ﬁ rm that if randomly selected individuals are told \n",
      "in completely anatomical terms to open their eyes very widely, part their lips, and protrude their tongues just a little, so they don’t quite show (thereby making the facial expression of disgust), then when they are asked what they feel, they will answer “disgust.” In other words, we often appear to learn how we feel by observing what we are doing (10). Some folks are mesmerized by a picture of a neuron in the brain lighting up and exciting a chain of neurons that eventually stimulate a muscle to wiggle your ﬁ nger. Mind over matter: the \n",

This en-tails particulars of his or her body, initially, and soon, the placement and functions of the common muscle groups. At that point the individual is ready to recognize signs such as the propensity of his or her adductors to cause scissoring, or the gluteus medius to go into spasm when descending more than four or ﬁ ve stairs.\n",
      "It helps to just be aware of either liability and the circumstances under \n",

The same stretching techniques that reduce the muscles’ tendency toward spasticity also strengthen them, increase the range of motion at the hips and ankles, and relax the distress that walking and stairs would otherwise entail. This anxiety would, naturally, disadvantageously heighten re ﬂ exes all the more. 115Knowing that one can avoid certain physiological situations, witnessing one-\n",

At that point, what is called for is exactly the job of work at which yoga excels: regaining energy and focus, stretching to expand range of motion, counter residual spasticity, and improve strength, coordination, and balance. These goals can be reached through sustained and variably complex postures. 116The same applies to any neurological compromise with functional sequelae, such \n",

But it is the recruitment of working tissue to new function, the formation of new centers to perform impaired functions, and the creation of new pathways that has now been convincingly documented to extend quite a bit later in life.

There is no better, safer, faster nor more natural way to overcome the restrictions on full movement than lengthening them.

Y et relapsing and remitting MS, with its rising and falling levels of motor and sen-sory impairment is frequently accompanied by temporarily increased spasticity .

      "tion may be lost unnecessarily due to failure to challenge the actual limits that impaired function imposes. These add up.

      "Strategies to \n",
      "Improve Range of Motion\n",
      "Many important groups of muscles cross \n",
      "more than one joint, and where these muscles are the limiting factors in joint mobility , both joints must be approached simultaneously . The gastrocnemius muscle, for example, crosses the back of both the ankle and the knee. If stretching it at the ankle is attempt-ed without regard for the straightness of the knee, it will be impossible to put it under any tension at all. However, once the muscle is stretched at the ankle, further straightening the knee is often a good method of increas-ing the range of motion at the ankle joint.\n",
      "In other circumstances, such as relapsing \n",
      "and remitting MS, it can happen that a given joint is inactive for a period of months due \n",
      "to weakness or spasticity that then remits or vanishes, leaving a competent and properly toned muscle across a joint that is “frozen” by tightened ligaments or constricting joint capsule. Then the critical strategy is to take the muscle out of play , arranging position so that the muscle is slack, enabling one to work directly on the restricting elements. In that case, to disengage the gastrocnemius, one would intentionally stretch the ankle with the knee bent.\n",
      "Reduced range of motion and spasticity \n",
      "often work together: tightened muscles serve to decrease range of motion at the joints they cross and decreased range of motion brings on tightened muscles which cannot be stretched, that readily react to everyday stimuli with painful spasticity . In this respect all the asanas given later for spasticity will also serve to extend range of motion. Never-theless, there are a number of other postures which accomplish this task more directly .\n",

He was becom-ing more and more isolated and depressed. His wife was a successful professional, and they had two young children. Their lives were moving on, and he felt inadequate and powerless. After a lengthy interview , he was convinced to give the adaptive yoga program a try provided his entering the program was kept con ﬁ dential. W e arrived at a series of \n",

First, on the advice of his doctor, he had reduced the medication for depression by half. He was taking a nap only once a day for less than 45 minutes, whereas before he was sleeping an hour in the morning, again in the afternoon, and retiring in the evening soon after dinner. The double vision only occurred if he became exhausted, or pushed beyond what would be considered reasonable. The numbness in the legs remained, but it was not the focus of his concern. His gait was steadier, with only a slight drag on the outer foot. He resumed his professional schedule with modi ﬁ cation, and \n",

He seemed to be listening and watching, coming closer each time, until I asked him if he was inter-ested in joining us, and if not, please go some-where else to do his wheeling around. Now , Big John always wore very bulky clothes, dark colors, and a grubby baseball cap pulled down over his eyes. Big John said that he would give our class a try , but he would not commit to becoming a member of the class. \n",

He had a background of acting and voiceovers, and showed that his mental facilities were mostly intact. W e were able to demonstrate that there was a whole range of asanas that he could do from the electric wheelchair that would improve his general health and well-being. Many of them are described and illus-trated in this book. Big John picked up the challenge and never missed a class if he could help it. 263AFTERWORD\n",

Now he wears light-colored shirts, his hair is washed and cut on a regular basis, and he has a good re-lationship with the other members of the class and the general public. He manages all of this with only limited movement, and he has taught those who assist him at home how to carry on the yoga home-practice so that he can continue to improve his skills in managing life with MS.2641.
